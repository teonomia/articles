msgid "The problem which confronts all non-Christian philosophies, and all ostensibly "
"Christian philosophies which presuppose to any degree the autonomy of man and a"
" world of brute factuality, is very simply this: How can brute facts ever be an"
"ything more than brute facts?"

msgid "For a consistent and biblically governed faith, all the facts of nature and his"
"tory are the creation of the triune God. The facts of nature and history are to"
"tally governed by the God who ordained them and created them and who, by His et"
"ernal decree and comprehensive counsel, absolutely undergirds their every detai"
"l. All facts are thus God-given facts. As Van Til stated it, “All that may be k"
"nown by man is already known by God. And it is already known by God because it "
"is controlled by God”1 All knowledge therefore is of God-created and God-interp"
"reted facts."

"the autonomy of man in a world of brute factuality, knowledge becomes a critica"
"l problem and, indeed, impossible. Philosophy is not a game nor an undergraduat"
"e exercise; when philosophy, in developing the implications of its premises, is"
" unable to account for the reality of our everyday experience and common knowle"

msgid "When we reject the God of Scripture and posit a universe of brute factuality, w"
"e do create for ourselves some very serious problems. The idea of brute factual"
"ity does eliminate the Creator God of Scripture, but it leaves us with a perhap"
"s infinite number of brute facts, totally irrational and impervious to reason, "
"having no pre-established pattern or meaning and being thus essentially isolate"
"d and autonomous facts. As an existentialist, autonomous man can deny that he h"
"as any essence, any God-given nature and determination; he may insist that he h"
"as being and must make or define his own essence. Then, however, all other men "
"and all other facts in the universe are in the same status: they have no essenc"
"e, no pre-established pattern, no meaning, and hence no definition. In such a s"
"ituation, nothing can be known if a man is faithful to his presuppositions."

msgid "The consistent Christian position must be a demand that men must be consistent "
"to their basic starting-point, to their presupposition. Their implicit metaphys"
"ical and epistemological principles will, if systematically carried out, requir"
"e the unbeliever to admit his impasse. The point of Van Til’s negative apologet"
"ics is to push the unbeliever to a recognition of his premises and of their ina"
"bility to furnish him with any valid knowledge. The Christian must especially c"
"hallenge the idea of neutrality. “In spite of this claim to neutrality on the p"
"art of the non-Christian, the Reformed apologist must point out that every meth"

"ruth or the falsity of Christian theism.”2"

"consistently Christian, the facts we confront are God-created and are governed,"
" like ourselves, by His predestinating counsel. If our presuppositions are grou"
"nded on autonomous man in a world of brute factuality, then the reference point"
" in all thinking is that omnipresent brute factuality. It is our presupposition"
" that makes facts intelligible and determines what a fact is. Before we approac"

" in terms of his premises. He assumes a uniformity and order in nature; he proc"
"eeds on the presupposition that reality is not total irrationality but does in "

"gain knowledge by assuming that the world is what God made it to be, while at t"

"od. With respect to His own person, God is totally self-conscious, and potentia"
"lity and actuality are one in Him; there is no unconsciousness in God nor any h"

"tion logically precedes the denotation and the connotation of all facts of whic"
"h it consists.”3 Instead of beginning with brute facts, we begin with the God w"
"ho created all facts, and all facts are meaningful and open to reason. The Chri"
"stian position makes science possible, because it establishes the validity of a"
" total pattern in all factuality. The only true explanation of every fact is in"
" God, and therefore to operate on borrowed premises, to assume a pattern while "
"failing to acknowledge either the pattern or its source, is to be inconsistent."
" The necessary self-existence of God must be our starting-point. “Accordingly, "
"the various hypotheses that are to be relevant to the explanation of phenomena "
"must be consistent with this fundamental presupposition. God is the presupposit"
