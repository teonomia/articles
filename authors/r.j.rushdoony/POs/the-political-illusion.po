msgid "It would be absurd to deny the importance of politics, but it is also very dang"
"erous to over-rate it. One of the persistent problems of Christendom has been t"
"he tendency to over-rate both church and state. In Numbers 18:21-26, we see tha"

" varied functions included education. Thus, worship per se received mainly a ti"

"for all males over 18, the same amount for all. As a result, both church and st"
"ate in Scripture are, however important, restricted in size and power. The powe"

" hope and salvation in machines. The universe was seen as a machine, and politi"

"echanism; once properly established, it would ensure the orderly processes of g"
"overnment and justice. Machine imagery was used well into this century by men l"
"ike Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Even t"
"he critics of the U. S. Constitution used the same language, saying, "the machi"
"nery of government under which we live is hopelessly antiquated (and) should be"
" overhauled." After World War II, as colonies were granted independence, they w"
"ere also given constitutions which had no meaning in terms of their cultures an"
"d laws. Not surprisingly, these constitutions soon became meaningless. Contrary"

"venant with Death, The Constitution, Law, and Equality in the Civil War Era (19"

" and the learning of judges. He boasted of having never read a law book and of "
"having based his decisions as a justice of the peace on "common sense and hones"
"ty" and of having "relied on natural born sense and not law learning." Thus, th"
"e certainty of the "mechanism" of the Constitution was giving way for many to t"
"he natural goodness of man's will. Such advocates of man's natural wisdom held "
"that no law or constitution could outweigh the will of man."

"	Many, of course, tried to combine the idea of constitutions and laws as t"
"he mechanism of justice and government with the idea of supremacy of the popula"
"r will, the majority, or the democratic consensus. As a result of this union of"
" the two ideas, it became commonplace to use the word "democracy" instead of "r"
"epublic" in describing the United States. The U.S. Constitution was re-interpre"
"ted along democratic lines, as was the British constitution. Will and mechanism"
" had become a unity and an instrument whereby man's problems would be solved. S"

"	Church and state have often seen themselves as man's saviors. One of the "
"premises of the states of the ancient world was that a stateless man was no lon"
"ger a man, that outside the state there was no salvation. A like belief has at "
"times been common to some churches. The Biblical faith, of course, is that ther"
"e is no salvation outside of Christ. Peter declares: "neither is there salvatio"
"n in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, wher"
"eby we must be saved" (Acts 4:12). Our Lord says plainly, "I am the way, the tr"
"uth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:16). (Iro"
"nically, I have been told by critics more than a few times that to believe in a"
" salvation exclusively through Christ is bigotry. These same people will declar"
"e that there is neither hope nor future, no salvation, in other words, for men "
"except through democracy. This is more than bigotry: it is pharisaic stupidity!"
