"endowed funds, and they are using the church to advance their anti-Christian pu"

"supported the pastors, have seen a minister or priest assigned to their church "
"who denounced his faith, preached doubts concerning Christ, promoted social rev"
"olution, and drove out of the church the very people whose faith, work, and dol"
"lars had built it. These Christians have been robbed: their church has been sto"
"len from them. When they protest the theft, these faithful believers are actual"
