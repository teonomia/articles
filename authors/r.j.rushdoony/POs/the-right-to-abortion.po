"one’s own child. The rhetoric of pro-abortion forces has strongly emphasized th"

msgid "Ironically, this assumption is a particularly vulnerable one. Abortion strikes "
"at the Christian premise that God’s law-word alone sets the rules whereby life "
"can be taken, and abortion has no place in the law of God. The most obvious fac"
