"	One of the most dangerous of ideas that have dominated men's minds is the"
" dream of total justice. This is a humanistic dream. The humanist has only one "
"world, this present life, and he is determined to make a heaven out of earth. T"
"he result is consistently hell on earth."

"	The menace of the dream of total justice is that it requires perfect peop"
"le and a perfect social order and state to establish itself. The fact is that m"
"an is a sinner; he is also unwilling to change, content with himself although d"
"iscontented with the world, and, by virtue of his fallen nature, a slave to sin"
" and hence a slave by design (John 8:31-36). As result, every dreamer of a worl"
"d of perfect justice, a habitation for supermen, and a realm of triumph for hum"
"anistic dogmas of justice, must begin to eliminate men as they are to make way "
"for men as they should be. The French Revolution planned the reduction of Franc"
"e's population to a malleable fraction of what it was; Nietzsche called for the"
" death of man to prepare the world for superman; the Russian Revolution and its"
" exported revolutions have meant the planned murder of all who represent the ol"
"d order. In cambodia, since 1975, half the nation has been killed to eliminate "
"all who cannot be reshaped in terms of the Marxist dream of a perfect order. Th"
"e cambodian Khmer Rouge leaders have killed off all who worked for the old orde"
"r, all christians, all who were educated, all who lived an urban life, all who "
"had been abroad, and all who had worked for foreigners."

"	No more murderous force has ever been unleashed by man against man than t"
"he humanistic dream of justice. Tyranny and evil have governed most of history,"
" but never more rigidly and thoroughly than by those who bring in totalitarian "
"controls in the name of total justice. In 1931, Charles Pettit's The Impotent G"
"eneral, a brief and light novel, was translated into English. when the old war "
"lord is replaced by an ideologue, the peasants are unhappy. A peasant is asked "
"if it is because of affection. "By no means...Tan Pan-tze was an infamous robbe"
"r, who shamefully harassed the countryside, thrashing inoffensive folk and rapi"
"ng women of all ages and conditions..." "Then may I ask why you appear to mourn"
" him?"...The peasant replied: "Simply because his successor, General Pou, is ve"
"ry much worse than he was...he extorts his tribute methodically, which is even "
"harder to endure... and, moreover, he now exacts the death penalty for non-paym"
"ent and he does so in a legalized manner which has multiplied the executions" ("
"p. 171)."

"	It is not surprising that, in the quest for total justice, the humanistic"
" regimes have instituted total terror. The people are whipped into line, "for t"

"	All this is logical. A better world does require better men! The question"

"	But total justice on earth is an impossible dream. Man does not have God'"
"s omnipotence nor omniscience: he cannot control nor see all things. Lacking to"

"ial and incomplete. Not every wrong can be righted, nor every balance restored."
" Men can live, under God, in a just society, but never in this world in a total"
"ly just society. For the humanistic state to seek total justice means claiming "
"God's omnipotence: the state must exercise total power for total justice. Likew"

"edicated to a humanistic faith in total justice will create total revolution. A"
"n order dedicated to the whole word of God and Christ's regenerating power can "
