msgid "All preaching is futile and pointless, St. Paul told the Corinthians, if Christ"
" did not actually rise from the dead in the same body which was crucified (1 Co"
"r. 15). The whole point of the good news the apostles proclaimed was that the p"
"ower of sin and death was forever broken by the atoning death and Resurrection "
"of Jesus Christ. If this teaching be not true, St. Paul added, then “we are fou"
"nd false witnesses of God” (v. 15). However, because Christ is risen from the d"
"ead, death and sin are broken in their power, and victory becomes the life of t"
