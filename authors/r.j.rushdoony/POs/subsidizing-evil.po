". Every time we give in charity to anyone, we are extending a private and perso"

" the hospital, we are giving them a subsidy because we consider them to be dese"

"t. 6:21). In other words, your loyalties will reveal your nature; you will put "
"your money where your heart is. If a man or a country subsidizes laziness, drun"
"kenness, illegitimacies, socialist states or countries, and revolutionary activ"
"ities, its action reveals the kind of moral order it prefers and desires. Every"
" act of charity or subsidy is an aid, an encouragement, to someone who is needy"
" and who we believe must survive. To further a criminal in his crime is to say "
"that we believe in crime. It is one thing in mercy to administer emergency help"
" to a wounded criminal; it is another thing to put him on a subsidy. Today, in "
"the name of charity, we are subsidizing evil on all sides and penalizing godly "
"people to do it. Even to condone something by silence, or without protest, is a"
" sin and involves complicity in the act, according to God: “When thou sawest a "
"thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers” "
"(Ps. 50:18)."

"y is an important part of this false charity. Third, basic to this kind of acti"
