"'s rights." Under his guidance, church consistories went after wife abusers. Th"

msgid "In that era, and for centuries before, powerful and prosperous elderly men and "
"women contracted marriages with very young women and men. The families of the y"
"oung complied with these arrangements for their personal advantages. Calvin fel"
"t strongly that such marriages should not be allowed. In January, 1557, the Con"
"sistory dissolved a marriage between a woman of "more than 70" with a man of 27"
" or 28. (Philip E. Hughes, ed: The Register of the Company of Pastors of Geneva"
" in the time of Calvin, p. 321. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1966.) Rules "
"were published to protect both men and women in marriage. To avoid deception, m"
"any rules were established. Thus, "strangers coming from a distant country" cou"
"ld not be permitted to marry in Geneva until a careful investigation of their p"
"ast and their family were made. (Hughes, p. 75.) A woman persecuted for her fai"

msgid "It would be an error to say that the pastors of Geneva were always wise in thei"

"s seen in its day as "the paradise of women" because of the receptivity of Calv"
"in and others to their plight and their need for justice. There was a reason fo"
"r this attitude. It was the revival of the Old Testament as an inseparable part"

msgid "We have a remarkable fact here in Calvin's reformation of Geneva. It was a city"
" rightly called in its day "the paradise of women." This is an aspect of the Re"
"formation which has been given insufficient attention. The reason is that these"
" reforms in civil and church law which made Geneva so remarkable in its day are"
" now associated with patriarchalism, and patriarchy is a hated word to the femi"
"nists in both skirts and trousers. It suggests visions of male oppression, domi"
"nation and rule. It has become a symbol of past and present evils."

msgid "The significant fact, however, is that patriarchalism was not male-centered but"
" faith-and family-governed. Modern men in the atomistic family often have more "
"power, if they choose to exercise it, than did patriarchal man. The reason was "
"a very clear one: patriarchal man was a trustee from the past to the future. In"
" I Kings 21, we see that Naboth did not feel that he had the right to sell the "
"family land no matter how much money King Ahab offered. The land was not his ex"
"cept as a trust from his forefathers to the generations yet unborn."
