"	James, the brother of our Lord, tells us very emphatically that “faith wi"
"thout works is dead” (James 2:26). I thought of this recently when I heard an o"
"lder man speak of the “old days” when silver dollars were the only kind of mone"
"y in circulation in this area, and good men refused to take paper dollars in ch"
"ange. Such paper money was despised as “funny money” and as likely sooner or la"
"ter to lose value. This attitude was commonplace when I was a boy farmers, ranc"
"hers, and miners carried deep leather pouch purses in their jeans to hold “dece"
"nt” money, silver change and silver dollars."

"that silver dollars were real money, and paper money would “belly up.” But did "
"he? I thought of him two nights later, as I read James 2:26. His “faith” in sil"
