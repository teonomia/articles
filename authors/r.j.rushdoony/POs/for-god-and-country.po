"	First, there is the law of God for the family. The family has a high and "
"central position in Biblical law. There are four laws that pertain to the famil"
"y in the Ten Commandments alone: "Honor thy father and thy mother, as the LORD "
"thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go"
" well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee" (Deuteronomy 5"
":16). The seventh commandment forbids adultery (Deut. 5:18), and the tenth, cov"
"etousness of our neighbor's wife, home and possessions (Deut. 5:21). The eighth"
" commandment (Deut. 5:19) forbids theft and protects property, and, in Biblical"
" law, property is seen as one of the central mainstays of family life. In the N"
"ew Testament, it is emphasized that a man's first human obligation is towards h"
"is family: "But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his "
"own house; he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel" (1 Timothy 5"
":8). A man's first and basic responsibility, in the realm of his relationships "
"towards his fellow men, is towards his own family. He cannot put them on the sa"
"me level as all mankind. The consequence of a universal ethics can only be comm"
"unism. In a universalistic morality, all men must be given the same love, suppo"
"rt, and consideration as we give to our family. It is impossible to do this-wit"
"hout total communism. But Biblical morality insists that the family, which must"
" be grounded on christian faith, must come first. A man is required to love and"
" support his wife; he is forbidden to love and support any other women. He must"
" support and discipline his children; he cannot do this for other children. A u"
"niversal ethics is a communistic ethics."

"love to our "brethren" in the faith. The early church established the order of "
"deacons and a deacon's fund for the care of widows (or orphans) who had no fami"

"ave scarcely met, because we share a common perspective, yet a neighbor, whom w"
"e see daily, is in reality a stranger to us, because his every belief is hostil"
"e to our's. God requires us to be partial to that which is our own. To give equ"

"	There is much to commend in the phrase, "For God and for Country," but th"
"ere is much against it. It is a handy phrase for the enemy to use in the future"
", with the help of apostate churches: "For God and Country," "For God and the F"
"atherland," or "For God and the Soviet Union" as apostate Russian churchmen say"
". But, as Joshua said, "choose ye this day whom ye will serve...but as for me a"
"nd my house, we will serve the LORD" (Joshua 24:15). But even more militates ag"
"ainst the phrase, "For God and country." With all due respect to the dedicated "
"and fine patriots who use it, the term makes an equation where no equality exis"
"ts. The phrase has a ring of truth, but it will not stand up to investigation. "
"It joins the absolute, God, with a relative, the country. We cannot link a rela"
"tive and an absolute together. We cannot call for service to "God and church" o"
"r to "God and school," because the service God requires, and the claims God has"
" on us, far transcend the claims of church, country, or school. The essence of "
"statism and totalitarianism is that it makes the relative absolute. It makes th"
"e state into another god; it gives to the state power and authority which right"
"fully belongs to God only. The state today is claiming too much. In the United "
"States, the purpose of the founding fathers was to limit severely the powers of"
" the federal government by means of the Constitution. The federal union had to "
"be strong enough to avoid impotence, but it could not claim powers which infrin"
"ged on God's sovereignty and man's liberty under God. The foundation of liberty"
" they saw in the faith. As George Washington said "Let it be simply asked, Wher"
"e is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of relig"
"ious obligation desert the oaths, which are the instruments of investigation in"
" courts of justice?" Patrick Henry said that subversive and revolutionary force"
"s from Europe were seeking to destroy "the great pillars of all government and "
"of social life; I mean virtue, morality and religion. This is the armor, my fri"
"end, and this alone, that renders us invincible... If we lose these, we are con"
"quered, fallen indeed!" How many men today can equal Patrick Henry's dedication"
" to his country? But Patrick Henry was a great American because of the greatnes"
"s of his faith, character, and intelligence, and because he brought a sense of "
"proportion and dedication to all things."
