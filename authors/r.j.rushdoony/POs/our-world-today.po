" and freedom of religion trial. Two street preachers were on trial and had been"
" arrested and imprisoned earlier. The judge in this case, unlike so many, was c"
"ourteous and conducted the trial with dignity; however, he readily admitted hea"
"rsay evidence against the two preachers. The city brought to the trial a zeal w"
"hich would have been more appropriate for a case involving rape or murder. I le"
"ft at the end of the first day, having given my testimony, but the memory of th"
"e case remains, together with a sharp awareness of this country’s degeneracy. P"
"astors and Christian School leaders, and children, are regularly on trial. Wido"
"ws and orphans, whom the Lord regards as the test of a people’s faith, are syst"
"ematically robbed by inheritance taxes, and most people, in and out of the chur"

"eam, I was back at the courtroom (where in fact no local pastor came to give op"
"en support, being fearful of the hostility or disfavor of the city fathers). In"
" my dream, three mildly friendly men unrelated to the trial offered to drive me"
" to the airport. There was an oppressive darkness in the air and in the minds o"
"f men. All had left faith and morality behind, and the world was Christless. We"
" stopped at an intersection; a nearly naked black girl of about 12 years ran cr"
"ying to the automobile, asking help. I demanded that she be taken in. Just then"
", a van, going in the opposite direction, pulled alongside of us; the two men i"
"n the cab, one black, one white, demanded the girl’s return. They mistook my re"
"fusal’s reason, and offered to sell her, adding that they could supply any age "
"or color, any sex, for any purpose. I demanded the driver gun the motor and lea"
"ve, and we escaped the slave-wagon. I asked the frightened girl her name, and s"
"he had none, only “girl.” The three men told me the girl was my “problem”; they"
" wanted no part of “stolen property.” I realized I was in a slave world without"
" Christ and Scripture, the law-word of God. Then I woke up with the recognition"
" that the world I live in and the world of my dream are not very far apart."
