"	When reference is made to the Christian nature of the United States, the "
"objection immediately raised is the absence of reference to Christianity in the"
" Constitution. The Constitution would never have been ratified had such referen"
"ce been made, and to safeguard themselves, the people sought and gained the fur"
"ther protection of the First Amendment. Its wording is significant: "Congress s"
"hall make no laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the f"
"ree exercise thereof." All the constituent states had in some form or other eit"
"her a Christian establishment or settlement, or specifically Christian legislat"
"ion. Religious tests for citizenship, blasphemy laws, singular or plural establ"
"ishments, and other religious settlements were the rule, jealously guarded and "
"prized, first against British interference, then against Federal usurpation. To"
" preserve the integrity and freedom of the specific forms of Christian statehoo"
"d of the constituent states, the Constitution forbade any jurisdiction to the F"
"ederal Union in this area. The answer to the present federal interference, wron"
"gly based on the Fourteenth Amendment, is not a Christian Amendment but the res"
"toration of the prior jurisdiction of the states."

"	The American Revolution was not a revolution in the modern sense of that "
"word. Moreover, it was a defensive war, fought to preserve American liberties f"
"rom the usurpation and invasion of Parliament. The colonies rightly charged the"
" crown with breach of feudal contract, whereby they could declare that contract"
" null and void. The Constitution was not designed to make the United States a ""
"nation," but to federate already existing states, whose previous unity had been"
" primarily in the British monarch and was now in the Federal Union. As a result"
", the term "United States" was a plural noun, taking a plural verb. The constit"
"uent states being various forms of Christian states, they forbade the Federal G"
"overnment to enter the area of religion to impose or forbid any establishment o"
"r settlement alien to the states. The freedom contemplated, therefore, was not "
"freedom of or from religion, but for religion in the constituent states."

"	The states thus were prior and determinative in this and other areas. But"
", more important, in most of the key areas, the counties were the basic and det"
"erminative unit of American civil government. Not only did many local religious"
" laws prevail with the central force of public support and legal power, but als"
"o the two other great arms of civil power were in the hands of the county: firs"
"t, the power to tax property, and, second, criminal law. This is the heart and "
"genius of the American civil structure, and the center of its resistance to tyr"
"anny. Hence the assault of federal, state, and metropolitan government planners"
" on the county unit. Hence the proposal, as currently in California, to do away"
" with county assessors and to remove control of property from the county unit.1"
" The revival and growth of the historic American settlement depends therefore o"
"n the Christian renewal of the citizenry and the renewal of the centrality of t"
"he local units of government. Not in Washington, but on the local level, the ba"
"ttle will be won or lost. The key resistance today is therefore to be found amo"
"ng those who battle for the integrity and independence from usurpation of the c"
"ounty government, among those who establish and further Christian schools, amon"
"g those, in short, who realize that the American answer to the problem of civil"
" power was originally a Christian one, and firmly anchored close to home."
