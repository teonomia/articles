"ah's, and between the work of a faithful pastor today and Elijah's calling. Eli"
"jah's was a time of judgment; ours is as well. But there is a deeper resemblanc"
"e. Elijah's day was an age of syncretism, of radical compromise between the wor"
"ship of the Lord and Baal worship. The two had been blended together to make on"
"e religion, so that a refusal to see the necessity for uncompromising religion "

"he unity of Baal worship and the faith of Jehovah (1 Kings 12:25-33). Israel ra"
"rely denied the Lord or professed open apostasy. Rather, it pursued a course of"
" religious syncretism, using the name of the Lord but absorbing with their reli"

"	The similarity does not end there. Ahab's day was one of prosperity, a fa"
"lse prosperity that was largely the product of inflation. Ahab had inherited a "
"strong realm from his father Omri, who had pursued syncretism on the one hand, "
"and financially advantageous alliances on the other. Ahab married a Phoenician "
"princess, Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians (1 Kings 16:31). "
"This placed him in a favored position with a wealthy merchant state. Our age, t"
"oo, has been marked by an inflationary prosperity, and the loosening of moral a"
"nd religious standards is one result. People want things, not qualities or virt"
"ues. Some Puritan autobiographies tell us of men's despair over their sins; now"
", despair is commonplace because people lack things. On all sides, men speak, a"
"fter President Kennedy, of "the revolution of rising expectations." This revolu"
"tion demands more material wealth for all men and diminishes the need for moral"
" and educational performance and excellence. It is now a virtue to tolerate evi"
"l and to be intolerant of any material lack for man."
