msgid "Law and economics are necessary aspects of man's daily life: it is impossible t"
"o live without them. The more a sound knowledge of law and economics decline in"
" a society, the more radical will the decay of that society be. A decadent and "
"dying society is one in which law and economics are in a state of radical decay"
" or collapse. Together with theology, law and economics constitute the foundati"
"ons of order in a society, and what men think of law and economics depends on t"
"heir theology."

msgid "At the heart of our contemporary problem are false theologies and philosophies,"
" and central among these is Manichaeanism. For Manichaeanism, the world is divi"
"ded into two different and alien substances, spirit and matter. Each is equally"
" ultimate, and both are self-sufficient and separate realms. To be spiritual in"
" the Manichaean sense means to be disdainful about and unconcerned with materia"
"l things, because they are alien and constitute a drag and a drain on the spiri"
"t. Spirit is held to be good, and matter, bad."

msgid "From the Biblical perspective, there are no two such different substances or be"
"ings (for in some dualistic religions there are two ultimate beings in and behi"
"nd the two substances). God is the maker of all things, and He created all thin"
"gs good. Because of the fall, all creation is equally fallen. "Spirit" and "mat"
"ter" are alike fallen; they do not constitute two different kinds of substance "
"or being. The distinction rather is between the uncreated Being of God and the "
"created being of all things else. Salvation is not redemption from matter but f"
"rom sin, the root of which is spiritual. Instead of despising matter, Biblical "
"faith works to exercise dominion over the material world as God's appointed Kin"
"gdom."

msgid "The Bible is full of very precise and detailed laws governing the material worl"
"d, the use of land, diet, wastes, wild life, and so on. When the Manichaean men"
"tality approaches such laws, it finds them offensive. They are as a result rule"
"d out, first, as a primitive form of religion for the supposedly primitive Old "
"Testament Hebrews, and, second, as merely a secret code, with all kinds of symb"
"olic meanings pointing to the truer and spiritual meaning, and rendering the li"
"teral meaning of the law as no more than a useless hull or shell."

msgid "The Manichaean influence on Western thought is profound, in both church circles"
" and amongst the humanists. The Manichaean overtones, for example of Barthianis"
"m are very obvious in the division between faith and history, between holy hist"
"ory and actual history. Barth thus "affirmed" the Virgin Birth as a spiritual f"
"act, but denied its historicity; Reinhold Niebuhr "affirmed" the bodily resurre"
"ction of Jesus Christ as a matter of faith but denied its historicity. For them"
", the world of faith must not be contaminated by the material world of history."

msgid "Law and economics are very material concerns, and basic to life. We are born in"
"to a law world, physical law, family law, church law, school law, civil law, an"
"d so on. We cannot escape from the law: law is inseparable from life and is a c"
"ondition of it. Not even death affords an escape from law, in that, physically "
"and religiously, we remain in God's universe of law."

msgid "In view of this, it is an eloquent evidence of our Manichaean heritage that mos"
"t students go through their entire schooling with no training in either law or "
"economics. What economics they do get is really not economics as such, but a st"
"udy of the political control and suppression of economics. It can be added that"
" most lawyers leave law school with no training in the theology and philosophy "
"of law."

msgid "But a true theology requires a study of law and economics. If theology takes se"
"riously, first, the fact that God is the Creator, it will recognize the relevan"
"ce of the material world and the centrality of law and economics. This it has n"
"ot done. The United States, for example, has well over half its population list"
"ed as church members, and their ignorance of law and economics is perhaps equal"
" to that of the unchurched. Such an ignorance is a practical denial of the doct"
"rine of creation and a tacit affirmation of Manichaeanism. Law and economics ha"
"ve theological foundations which cannot be ignored. Our present crisis makes cl"
"ear that law and economics decay without that basis."

msgid "The restoration of Christendom means thus a denial of Manichaeanism, implicit a"
"nd explicit, and the development of a theology with Biblical roots. This requir"
"es a restoration of law and economics to a position of centrality in education "
"and in human affairs. The rise of statism has been in large measure due to a th"
"eological default and withdrawal from the material world. To the redeemed man, "
"the creation mandate to exercise dominion and to subdue the earth (Gen. 1:26-28"
"), emphatically applies. This, under the guidance of Biblical theology, require"
