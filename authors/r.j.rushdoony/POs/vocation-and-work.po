msgid "The word vocation comes from the Latin and means in origin a bidding or a calli"
"ng; to a remarkable degree, the word has retained its original meaning. Words, "
"like other things, commonly erode or alter their meanings. The Christian doctri"
"ne of every man's vocation or calling came into its own with the Reformation, a"
"lthough not without some preparation for it in the medieval era."

"	The doctrine of vocation or calling gained currency as men began to take "
"time and history seriously. If the goal of the Christian life is a neoplatonic "
"flight from this world, then pietism has effectively undermined the doctrine of"
" non-ecclesiastical callings. To speak of having a calling is usually to speak "
"of the clergy and clerical office."

"	However, some non-Christian cultures have sought to take time and history"
" seriously, as witness humanism today, without having any sense of a calling. T"
"he missing factor is taking God even more seriously. Without the sovereignty of"
" God to undergird and ensure the validity and efficacy of a calling, man works "
"in a void, a vast, meaningless emptiness. He floats aimlessly in inner space. W"
"here men believe in the triune God and take time and history seriously as the a"
"rena of God's Kingdom work, they can then both work and rest with confidence an"
"d peace. Where God is man's Lord and man's ultimate and essential environment, "
"then man is responsible and effective in his actions. Where, however, man is wi"
"thout God, his environment becomes a hostile and determinative force, and man i"
"s stripped of responsibility. For the godly man, because God is the Lord and th"
"e determiner, man is not under the control of his physical environment, and tim"
"e becomes the partner and aide to eternity. Man then knows he is not alone in w"
"hat he does, and more is involved in his actions than himself. At a critical po"
"int, man then rests and works in God in the confidence of God's efficacious act"

"	Note Luther's comment: "Do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by dest"
"roying the object which is abused. Men can go wrong with wine and women. Shall "
"we then prohibit wine and abolish women?" The answer is that, in a godless univ"
"erse, the total conflict of interests prevails, not a harmony of interests. In "
"such a conflict cosmos, the goal becomes total war against the supposed source "
"of trouble. Hence, class warfare, racial conflict, and generational tensions be"
"come commonplace. A man's vocation then becomes the obliteration or the eradica"
"tion of supposed sources of trouble. This means total war against the capitalis"
"ts or the communists, or against some particular race. Evil then becomes a meta"
"physical principle, some segment of being, rather than a moral fact, what men d"
"o with themselves. The consequences for work are very great."

"	We have seen that a vocation is a calling. The Reformation stressed work "
"under God as a calling or vocation. Since then, however, the meaning of calling"
" or vocation has tended to be restricted. Men think of a vocation as something "
"professional and a calling as religious and ecclesiastical. On the other hand, "
"work has a different kind of origin. It comes from the Anglo-Saxon wore, and it"
" refers to the exertion of strength to do something. Work is akin to the Greek "
"ergon, work; to erdein, to do, sacrifice; and to orgia, secret rites. As a resu"
"lt, because work has reference to physical labor, work has become separated fro"
"m vocation or calling, a very unbiblical consequence. It must be stressed, ther"
"efore, that for us work must be a vocation or calling under God."

"	Not only work but life apart from God is meaningless. Work then becomes a"
" question of survival economics, gaining enough food and shelter to live. For a"
"ll too many people in history, work has had this connotation. Its goal has been"

"	However, in the Bible work is eschatological in meaning. It has a goal, t"
"he Kingdom of God. Work can be drudgery, a necessary means of survival, or work"
" can be a means of dominion and subduing the earth (Gen. 1:26-28). Work can be "
"a means of maintaining life and no more, or work can be the means of creating t"
"he future. Work thus can be done simply to maintain the status quo, or it can b"
"e the means of determining our tomorrows. Where work is eschatologically govern"
"ed by the dominion mandate, it is constructive of things present and future. Th"
"e modern era has seen the flourishing and decline of the idea of progress, but "
"progress is simply the secular face of Biblical eschatology. The doctrine of pr"
"ogress sees "history" moving onward and upward, and its tenets are secularized "
"versions of the post-millennial faith. Without a faith in God, the idea of prog"
"ress soon withers; all activity in a void ends up a void."
