msgid "One of the most basic and continuing problems of man's history is the question "
"of the one and the many and their relationship. The fact that in recent years m"
"en have avoided discussion of this matter has not ceased to make their unstated"
" presuppositions with respect to it determinative of their thinking."

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "Much of the present concern about the trends of these times is literally wasted"
" on useless effort because those who guide the activities cannot resolve, with "
"the philosophical tools at hand to them, the problem of authority. This is at t"
"he heart of the problem of the proper function of government, the power to tax,"
" to conscript, to execute for crimes, and to wage warfare. The question of auth"
"ority is again basic to education, to religion, and to the family. Where does a"
"uthority rest, in democracy or in an elite, in the church or in some secular in"
"stitution, in God or in reason? The implications of the problem are religious, "
"as will be shown, but the fact that it is not discussed permits an ignorant equ"
"alization of various religions and diverse theologies. The differences between "
"Christianity and atheism are basic, as are the differences between Buddhism and"
" Christianity. Russian Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Lutheranism, "
"and Calvinism each has its characteristic culture of consequence in the social "
"and political action of its own presupposition. Failure to recognize the fact t"
"hat all routes to God are not equally valid or relevant to the maintenance of h"
"istoric Western culture, especially in the United States, has extensively cloud"
"ed the possibility of an intelligible answer. The plea that this is a pluralist"
"ic culture is merely recognition of the problem-not an answer. The problem of a"
"uthority is not answerable to reason alone, and basic to reason itself are pre-"
"theoretical suppositions or axioms1 which represent essentially religious commi"
"tments. And one such basic commitment is with respect to the question of the on"
"e and the many.2 The fact that students can graduate from our universities as p"
"hilosophy majors without any awareness of the importance or centrality of this "
"question does not make the one and the many less basic to our thinking. The dif"
"ference between East and West, and between various aspects of Western history a"
"nd culture, rests on answers to this problem which, whether consciously or unco"
"nsciously, have been made. Whether recognized or not, every argument and every "
"theological, and philosophical, political, or any other exposition is based on "
"a presupposition about man, God, and society-about reality. This presupposition"
" rules and determines the conclusion; the effect is the result of a cause. And "
"one such basic presupposition is with reference to the one and the many."

msgid "This avoidance of the problem makes necessary a few elementary definitions as a"
" prelude to a discussion. The one refers not to a number but to unity and onene"
"ss; in metaphysics, it has usually meant the absolute, the supreme Idea for Pla"
"to, the universe for Parmenides, Being as Such for Plotinus, and so on. The one"
" can be a separate whole, or it can be the sum of things in their analytic or s"
"ynthetic wholeness; that is, it can be a transcendent one, which is the ground "
"of all being, or it can be an immanent one. The many refers to the particularit"
"y or individuality of things; the universe is full of a multitude of beings; is"
" the truth concerning them inherent in their individuality, or is it in their b"
"asic oneness? If it is their individuality, then the many are ultimate and the "
"proper source of authority, and we have philosophical Nominalism. If it is thei"
"r oneness, then the one is ultimate, and we have Realism. According to Realism,"
" universals, which are terms applicable to all the universe and can be called r"
"eal "second substances," are aspects of the one Idea and exist within it. Egypt"
"ian, much Greek, and medieval scholastic thought has been "Realistic." For "Nom"
"inalism," abstract or general terms have no real existence and are mere names a"
"pplied to aspects of reality; reality belongs to particulars, actual physical p"
"articulars, so that the truth of being is simply that individual things exist. "
"Truth is not some abstraction concerning particular things but is simply the fa"
"ct of particularity."

msgid "Orthodox Christianity has asserted another answer to the problem, and, to make "
"clear that answer, certain elementary distinctions are necessary. Theology and "
"philosophy distinguish between the ontological trinity and the economical trini"
"ty in speaking of God. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are each a perso"
"nality, and together they constitute the triune and exhaustively personal, tota"
"lly self-conscious God. God is totally self-conscious, meaning that He has no h"
"idden, unknown aspects of His being, no unexploited potentiality. He is actuali"
"ty, self-conscious and personal. Each person of the trinity is equally God."

"omes apparent that these two seemingly contradictory aspects of being do not ca"
"ncel one another but are equally basic to the ontological trinity: one God, thr"
"ee persons. Again, since temporal unity and plurality are the products and crea"
"tion of this triune God, neither the unity nor the plurality can demand the sac"
"rifice of the other to itself. Thus man and government are equally aspects of c"
"reated reality. The locus of Christianity is both the believer and the church; "
"they are not independent of or prior to one another. The wishes of husband and "
"wife do not take priority over marriage, nor does the institution of marriage h"
"ave primacy over the partners to it; marriage indeed is a type of an eternal re"
"ality (Eph. 5:22-25), but man is himself created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26"
"-27). Education must be geared both to the individual and to society, but, abov"
