"ho borrowed.[2] These were then debts of emergency and hence speedily repaid[3]"
" when the emergency ended. The "emergency" might be, as with Judah, not a valid"
" one, but only a temporary exigency normally led to debt. More usually, debts i"
"n Israel were the products of failures of crops and heavy foreign tribute.[4] B"
"orrower and lender were cited by Isaiah as types in the nation,[5] but it is si"
"gnificant that the Hebrew had no clear-cut word for debtor, which fact appears "
"in I Samuel 22:2. The reading here for debtor is "everyone that was in debt," o"
"r, as the marginal reading gives it, "every one that had a creditor." This woul"
"d indicate that a debtor class did not exist, no word existing for it. Emergenc"

" so that foreclosures were valid to the middle and end of each century (when th"
"is law was observed). The land was to rest, to lie fallow, on each seventh year"
", this being the release of the land as well as of debts.[10] The Babylonian Ca"
"ptivity lasted seventy years because seventy sabbath years were due to the land"
