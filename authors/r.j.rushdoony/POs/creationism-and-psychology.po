"guidance in pastoral counselling, and books applying such psychologies to pasto"

"s necessary, first, to recognize that man is declared to be a creature, created"
" by the sovereign act of God on the sixth day of creation (Genesis 1: 26-31). T"
"his fact gives us a radically different picture of man than that provided by ev"
"olution. Instead of emerging out of chaos and an animal ancestry, man is the di"

"	This means, second, that man has a short history, not a long and unknown "
"past. That short history is very extensively documented by Scripture as well as"
" by man's own records. Man is therefore subject to explanation by a documented "
"record, not a long and hypothetical past. This documented record makes excuse a"
"nd evasion less tenable, whereas an unknown past erodes responsibility and intr"
"oduces confusion and uncertainty. Thus, for the Christian, man's psychology is "

" to man the meaning of his existence. Existentialism is more honest here than m"
"ost humanistic philosophies and psychologies; it does not define man or ascribe"
" a meaning to life and man: "Man is." For existentialism if man is anything, it"
" is because man makes and defines himself. This self-definition is essentially "
"an anarchistic process, in that each man is his own universe and the god of tha"
"t private universe. According to Scripture, however, man was created, and every"
" man is born into, an already defined universe made by God, and every man has a"
" specific responsibility to that triune God and to men and the universe under G"

"of his life also. At no point in his life or imagination can man step outside o"
"f God's ordained order into a realm of humanistic or man-made freedom. The free"
"dom of man is itself a condition of God's creation. Every hair on man's head, e"

"	\n"
"		Then after emphasizing that man was like God and "
"in the nature of the case had to be like God we must stress the point that man "
"must always be different from God. Man was created in God's image. We have seen"
" that some of God's attributes are incommunicable. Man can never in any sense o"
"utgrow his creaturehood. This puts a definite connotation into the expression t"
"hat man is like God. He is like God, to be sure, but always on a creaturely sca"
"le. He can never be like God in God's aseity, immutability, infinity and unity."
" For that reason the church has embedded into the heart of its confessions the "
"doctrine of the incomprehensibility of God. God's being and knowledge are absol"
"utely comprehensive; such knowledge is too wonderful for man; he cannot attain "
"unto it. Man was not created with comprehensive knowledge. Man was finite and h"
"is finitude was originally no burden to him. Neither could man ever expect to a"
"ttain to comprehensive knowledge in the future. We cannot expect to have compre"
"hensive knowledge even in heaven. It is true that much will be revealed to us t"
"hat is now a mystery to us but in the nature of the case God cannot reveal to u"
