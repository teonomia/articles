"	Few things are more commonly misunderstood than the nature and meaning of"
" theocracy. It is commonly assumed to be a dictatorial rule by self-appointed m"
"en who claim to rule for God. In reality, theocracy in Biblical law is the clos"
"est thing to a radical libertarianism that can be had. In Biblical law, the onl"
"y civil tax was the head or poll tax, the same for all males twenty years of ag"
"e and older (Ex. 30:16). This tax provided an atonement or covering for people,"
" i.e., the covering of civil protection by the state as a ministry of justice ("
"Rom. 13:1-4). This very limited tax was continued by the Jews after the fall of"
" Jerusalem, and, from 768-900 A.D., helped make the Jewish princedom of Narbonn"
"e (in France) and other areas a very important and powerful realm (see Arthur J"
". Zuckerman: A Jewish Princedom in Feudal France 768-900; New York, N.Y.: Colum"
