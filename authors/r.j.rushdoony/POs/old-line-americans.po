"	I lived as a child in California. My immigrant parents, refugees from Arm"
"enia and the Turkish massacres, moved to California from New York a few weeks a"
"fter my birth in 1916. We lived on a farm near Kingsburg, a Swedish town. Even "
"when I was in high school, Kingsburg’s mayor, a Swede, spoke a heavily accented"
" English. Besides the Swedes, there were Armenians, Danes, Portuguese, Japanese"
", Mexicans, and a few others. When I started kindergarten, my English, like tha"
"t of the other children, was limited. In the first grade, I met my first “real "
"American,” an elderly woman teacher named Mrs. Pinkley. I have forgotten the na"
"mes of others of my early teachers, but I remember hers, because we were all im"
"pressed by this “real American.” Years later, I realized that a very few old-li"
"ne Americans did live in the area, but none were near us."

"	In the early 1920s, when my father became pastor of an Armenian church in"
" Detroit, we left by train for that city. As a youngster, it was for me a great"
" adventure as well as a major dislocation. On board the train, I was immediatel"
"y interested in the man who seemed to me to be the most important man running t"
"he train, and the strongest, the Pullman porter. He was also the first black ma"
"n I had ever seen. I followed him around, to his tolerant amusement, and I bega"
"n to ask questions. As a boy in Kingsburg, I knew that there all of us identifi"
"ed people in terms of their country of origin: “What country does your family c"
"ome from?” Accordingly, I asked him the same question, and, “What language did "
"they speak?” The answers were surprising: he came from Chicago, and his family "
"from Alabama. His grandparents? Alabama. His great-grandparents, his great-grea"
"t-grandparents? He was amused: “As far back as I know, Alabama,” and all spoke "
"English. I then knew that I had met my second “real American.”"

"	Looking back years later, I realized how right I was. Apart from the Indi"

"e Americans” and “real Americans,” because their lives, culture, and outlook ar"
