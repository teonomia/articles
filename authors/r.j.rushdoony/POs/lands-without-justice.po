msgid "St. Augustine, in his study of society, The City of God, made clear how basic t"
"o true society justice is. A society which is not grounded on the triune God an"
"d His law is a society destined to reveal its basic hostility to justice. As St"
". Augustine remarked, of the civil turmoil of the Roman republic, “Peace vied w"
"ith war in cruelty, and surpassed it: for while war overthrew armed hosts, peac"
"e slew the defenceless. War gave liberty to him who was attacked, to strike if "
"he could; peace granted to the survivors, not life, but an unresisting death.” "
"(Bk. III, 28). Moreover, said Augustine, a nation without justice is no differe"
"nt than a band of robbers. “Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms b"
"ut great robberies? For what are robberies themselves, but little kingdoms?” (B"
"k IV, 4). Every band of robbers, and every criminal syndicate, Augustine went o"
"n to state, has an authority, a head, a body of rules or laws, its own self-pol"
"icing, its fixed territories and cities, and operates exactly as a nation does."
" Remove justice from a nation and it has little to distinguish it from a band o"
"f robbers or a criminal syndicate."

msgid "In order to understand the necessity for justice, it is important to know what "
"the word justice means. The dictionary states that justice is the administratio"
"n or maintenance of that which is just, and the root word, just, is defined as "
"righteous, so that justice is righteousness. Although dictionaries now tend to "
"play down the religious aspect of the word righteousness, it still has, and cor"
"rectly so, a religious connotation in the popular mind."

msgid "In the Bible, righteousness and justice are basically the same words and ideas."
" Justice and righteousness mean moral and religious perfection, so that God is "
"spoken of as not onlyperfect righteousness and justice but also as the source o"
"f all righteousness and justice. Justice on the human scene means the rule of G"
"od’s righteousness among men in two ways: first, by the operation of divine gra"
"ce in the heart of man, and, second, by means of the ministry of justice throug"
"h civil government. By means of the state, by civil government, God’s righteous"
"ness is to be expressed in law, godly law, and the order this law establishes i"
"s justice. Take away God’s standard of righteousnessfrom the law, and you strip"
" the law of justice and reduce it to anti-law."

msgid "Without justice, the law becomes a form of theft. Stripped of justice, the law "
"becomes an instrument of extortion and oppression in the hands of whatever grou"
"p of men control it. If men of wealth control the state, the law becomes their "
"tool to subjugate the poor and to make them poorer. If poor men control the sta"
"te, the law then is used to rob the rich and all hardworking men to support tho"
"se who want to live on the proceeds of robbery. In the one case it is called th"
"e maintenance of the social order, and in the other it is called social justice"
" and social welfare, but in both cases it is robbery. And today, because God’s "
"righteousness is despised, the nations of the world are becoming robber states "
"and lands without justice."

msgid "Humanism has been responsible for creating these robber states. By denying the "
"relevance of God’s law to man’s law, and by divorcing law from the righteousnes"
"s of God, humanism has made the law the expression of man’s logic and experienc"
"e. God’s higher law is denied, and man becomes the ultimate law and lawgiver. T"
"he only difference then between the criminal syndicate and the modern state is "
"that the state claims to have the general will of a nation behind it; the lesse"
"r order of thecriminal syndicate is thus ruled out as an illegitimate order. Bu"
"t this limited logic could lead a world state to call a national state a crimin"
"al order because it merely represents a limited segment of the world’s peoples."

msgid "Moreover, because humanism has no ultimate right or wrong, its law is democrati"
"c law, that is, it simply expresses the will of the people. But the will of man"
", whether as an individual or en mass, is, according to Scripture, a sinful wil"
"l. Sinful man is not interested in justice; he is interested in himself, in get"
"ting more and more of the best for himself. When man’s sinful will is the only "
"source of the law, as it is for humanism, then the law becomes legalized robber"

msgid "With socialism, or legalized robbery, the appetite for robbery is only increase"
"d. Men who begin to steal find stealing to be their favored way of progress, an"
"d, as a result, theft rather than work becomes steadily more and more basic to "
"the socialistic robber state. Men find it profitable to live by legalizedtheft,"
" and they demand all the more of it. As a result, while socialism calls itself "
"the workers’ state, it is in actuality a robbers’ state, wherein the robbers li"
"ve off the workers and insist that the workers thank them for this new paradise"
"! Nowhere are workers more oppressed than under socialism, and yet they are con"
"tinually asked to hail, praise, and thank the thieves who live off of them."

msgid "Lands without justice, robber states, are the consequence of humanism, of a law"
" divorced from God’s righteousness. Basic therefore to every resistance to the "
"criminal syndicate states are two things: first, personal faith in Christ as Sa"
"vior, and, second, God’s righteousness as the foundation of civil order, of law"
" and of justice. Apart from this, we are merely fighting humanism with more hum"
"anism, which is comparable to fighting fire with gasoline."

msgid "In a land without justice, sympathy tends to favor the unjust rather than the j"
"ust. As a result, sympathy and pity go out to criminals, not to victims. Every "
"kind of legal protection is increasingly afforded the criminal and less and les"
"s to the godly and the law-abiding citizen. We are told that we must love the t"
"hief, prostitute, homosexual, and murderer, and that to demand punishment for c"
"rimes is to be ugly and vengeful, but little love and pity are shown for the vi"
"ctims of their crimes. We live in one of history’s most sentimental eras, and a"
"ll this sentimentality is lavished upon the hoodlums and criminals of society. "
"In many circles, it is impossible to criticize these hoodlums and criminals wit"
"hout becoming a social outcast. When popular feeling runs so strongly in favor "
"of the lawless, we will always see the progressive growth of a land without jus"
"tice."

msgid "To restore justice, we must restore God to His rightful place in our personal a"
"nd national lives. For Scripture, true civil governments not only derive their "
"power from God but also their law. According to Scripture, “power belongeth unt"
"o God” (Ps. 62:11), and all powers on the human scene can onlybe exercised acco"
"rding to His word. God “removeth kings, and setteth up kings” (Dan. 2:21), and "
"“the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he wil"
"l” (Dan. 4:32). St. Paul stated that “[T]here is no power but of God, the power"
"s that be are ordained of God” (Rom. 13:1). InAmerica, during most of its histo"
"ry, God has been recognized as the source of government by the people and by th"
"e courts. At the very beginning, the purpose was openly and proudly stated to b"
"e the establishment of godly governments. Thus, the Preamble to the Connecticut"
" Constitution of 1639declared, “Where a people are gathered together the word o"
"f God requires that to maintain the peace and union … there should be an orderl"
"y and decent Government established according to God.”"

msgid "Our courts once agreed with St. Augustine that, “if Justice be taken away, what"
" are governments but great bands of robbers?” Thus, a decision of 1905 stated, "
"“If through the courts of justice, a man can be chiseled out of his property…th"
"en it would be well to abolish the courts, and let every man, like the ‘heathen"
" rage’ and be ‘a law unto himself.”1 A decision of 1921 said also, “The right o"
"f courts to exist and function rests upon their power to mete out fundamental j"
"ustice.”2 Where justice is removed from a court, that court simply becomes a po"
"litical tool whereby one class oppresses another, and justice is replaced by in"
"justice. This, of course, is the theory of Marxist law, for communism uses the "
"law and the courts as a tool for the dictatorship of the proletariat and the op"
"pression of all who in any way oppose, disagree with, or fall out of favor of t"
"he totalitarian state."
