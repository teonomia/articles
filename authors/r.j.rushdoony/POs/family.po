"story: the trustee, the domestic, and the atomistic families. The trustee famil"
"y has central authority in a society: it is the basic power and institution, an"
"d most government is in its hands. The trustee family sees its possessions and "
"its work as an inheritance from the past to be transmitted to the future. The f"

" to the family as trustee. This means that authority in the family, i.e., the a"

" very clearly in Ephesians 5:21-33. The matter of family authority is theologic"
"al. The husband's headship is established by God as a ministry through the fami"
"ly. His authority, while resting in his person, is not personal; it is religiou"

"o the word of God; when he departs from it, God will confound his authority. Wo"
"men and children will then rule over men and be their oppressors (Isa. 3:4, 12)"

"well as the vocations, is ministerial (Eph. 6:5-9) and theological rather than "
"personal. The personal exercise of authority for the sake of power is the mark "

msgid "Since Biblical authority is a trusteeship from the Lord, it is basic to that au"
"thority that it must be exercised in the name of the Lord for His Kingdom. What"
" we are and have belongs neither to us, to the family, the church, or the state"
", but to the Lord and His Kingdom. We must thus protect ourselves and our posse"
"ssions from the attempts by an ungodly heir, or by the state, to gain possessio"
"n over them as if the right of inheritance were a personal fact. Inheritance, h"
"owever, is a theological principle, with an eschatological framework. It must s"
"erve the purposes of God and His Kingdom, and its goal is the new creation, and"
" all the glory of the earth made an inheritance of God's Kingdom."
