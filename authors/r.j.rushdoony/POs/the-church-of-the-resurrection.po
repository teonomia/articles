"f Jesus Christ. We can thus say, very simply: no resurrection, no church. The m"

msgid "The true church rests on a miracle, and the power of that miracle, and therefor"
"e the church and its members live a miraculous and providential life in Christ."
" The church thus cannot see itself as simply an institution: it is the power an"
"d presence of God the Son in history, and it is informed and guided by God the "
"Spirit. The formal gathering and organization of the church followed the resurr"
"ection and the ascension. The miracle of Christ's resurrection means the miracl"
"e of our regeneration, and we by God's grace and power have been raised "up tog"
"ether, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus" (Eph. 2:6)."
" The exaltation of Christ by means of His resurrection and ascension is the exa"

msgid "From one perspective, we can say that these verses say nothing about the church"
"; from another, we must say that they say everything about the church. We are t"
"old that we have been delivered from one exousia, dominion, to another, from th"

" prince of the power of the air," from this world and the naturalistic power an"
"d dominion of this fallen realm, to the supernatural domain, to "sit together i"
"n heavenly places in Christ Jesus." We must not overlook the significance of to"
" "sit together." Normally, in the presence of a king, a man prostrated himself "
"at the King's feet, or, if he stood, it was by the grace of the king. By grace "
"we are made to "sit together," i.e., to be enthroned and to reign with Him. Our"
" calling and the church's calling is to power and dominion in Christ; we are re"

msgid "The fallacy of most studies of Ephesians 2:1-9 is that these verses are seen as"
" applying only to the individual. The Roman Empire, like modern culture, was at"
"omistic. Paul speaks against this atomistic individualism. He contrasts the old"
" and the new humanities, the fallen mankind governed by the spirit of rebellion"
", by Satan's dominion of sin, as against the new humanity regenerated and recre"
"ated by Jesus Christ, the last Adam (I Cor. 15:45-50). Paul's words here are th"
"e prelude to his exposition of the union of Christ and the church (Eph. 5:21-33"
"); it is set in the context of a covenantal view of man and life. What we too o"
"ften forget is that Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism are defective, not only be"
"cause of their false doctrine of sin, but also because of their lack of a true "
"covenant; man is seen atomistically and individually, and man is thus capable t"
"o some degree of an independent approach to God. By closing the door to any suc"
"h thinking as tenable, Paul stresses the corporateness of man, either in Adam o"
"r in Christ, and hence the necessity of the church. As a result, contrary to th"
"e modern emphasis, Paul is not so much stressing our salvation as rather what h"
"e cites in Ephesians 1:19, "the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who"
" believe, according to the working of his mighty power." We are saved by God's "
"grace and the "the working of his mighty power," and we are summoned to rejoice"
" in that mighty power, not simply our new estate. The church of the resurrectio"
"n will thus do more than rejoice in its salvation; it will know and move to vic"
"tory in terms of God's mighty power, His miraculous working in us, in the churc"
"h, and in history. We are delivered from "the course of this world," or the evi"
"l power of this world which once worked in us, into the mighty power of the tri"
"une God. We move from a reprobate to a redeemed estate, but this is not all, fo"
"r to limit our salvation to this is to deform it. We move from the evil and nat"
"uralistic course of this fallen world, from the spirit of the evil one, into th"
"e supernatural working, power, and Spirit of the triune God. We move from death"
" to life, and from defeat to victory, "For the wages of sin is death, but the f"
"ree gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Rom. 6:23)."

msgid "To "sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus" is enthronement. In Christ"
" man is restored to his covenant calling to be God's priest, prophet, and king "

"s of it as "the ages to come" to emphasize to us, with our temporal consciousne"

msgid "Thus, it is not the Messiah who is alone raised from the dead, but all of us wh"
"om He chooses. Paul, in Ephesians 1:19-23, speaks of the resurrection of Christ"
", His exaltation, and His headship over the church (Eph. 1:22-23). The resurrec"
"ted Lord then resurrects us, He makes alive or quickens us who were dead in sin"
"s and trespasses. Thus, Ephesians 2:1ff. speaks of the power of the resurrectio"
"n creating a church and making a dead people alive. Only by ignoring Ephesians "
"1:19-23 can we then read the following verses individualistically. The early ch"
"urch rightly stressed the doctrine of the Two Ways, of which Scripture has much"
" to say (e.g., Ps. 1; 34:12-22; Matt. 7:13-14; etc.). There is a way of death, "
"and a way of life, a way of defeat, and a way of victory. "But God, who is rich"
" in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us" (Eph. 2:4), hath created u"
"s "in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we shou"
"ld walk in them" (Eph. 2:10). This is not all: God, while we were yet sinners a"
"nd dead in sin, "quickened us together with Christ" (Eph. 2:5). Our regeneratio"
"n is grounded in and an aspect of Christ's resurrection. The birth of the churc"
"h and our regeneration in Christ are alike aspects of the miracle of the resurr"

"9:17; Mark 10:18; Luke 18:19), and because God alone is truly and absolutely go"

"impotence of the good is to believe in Satan and in Satan's program (Gen. 3:1-5"
") as alone powerful and effectual. To deny the power and the victory of the goo"
