msgid "To be prayerless, we have seen, is to claim autonomy from God. The prayerless m"
"an trusts in his own resources to deliver him from all problems and difficultie"

msgid "Whenever a man is ruled by a spirit of autonomy, he is then capable essentially"
" of self prayer only. He worries, frets, and cudgels his brains in order to fer"
"ret out the secret of salvation within himself. Our Lord spoke to the heart of "
"all anxiety when He said, "Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unt"
"o his stature?" (Matt. 6:27). Autonomy is marked by anxiety. Existentialism thu"
"s has much to say about the role of anxiety in the life of man, because anxiety"
" is the mark of autonomy. Anxiety seeks to do what only God can do, to perform "
"miracles and to govern by acts of providence the course of human affairs. Worry"
" and anxiety are the marks of prayerlessness; they mark the man who seeks to be"
" the master of his own fate, and the captain of his own soul. All too many anxi"
"ous people and chronic worriers try to pass themselves off as superior and sens"
"itive souls when they are in fact godless ones. The alternative to prayer is an"
"xiety and worry."

msgid "To be prayerless is to regard ourselves as autonomous, and to believe, implicit"
"ly or explicitly, in our autonomy is to deny the doctrine of creation. Scriptur"
"e is clear that the triune God made all things by His sovereign word in six day"

"enial of creationism is to be prayerless. To be prayerful is a practical affirm"

"he governor and the redeemer of our lives. We then separate ourselves from life"
". The penalty for sin is death (Gen. 2:17; Rom. 6:23). To seek autonomy and ind"
"ependence from God is to hate God and to love death (Prov. 8:36). It is the ess"
"ence of sin to declare that man is his own god, knowing or determining for hims"
"elf what constitutes good and evil (Gen. 3:5). On the other hand, the redeemed "
"of God know themselves to be God's creation and re-creation, the Lord's possess"
"ion and his handiwork. Instead of seeking independence, they manifest rather by"
" prayer and the totality of their faith, obedience, and life their dependence u"

" our ideas, reactions, delights, and concerns. Our conversation does not start "
"and stop: it is continual, although there can be time gaps of many minutes in b"
"etween words. So too with prayer. The heart of prayer is dependence and communi"
"on. If we enjoy that dependence and communion, we pray at all times, sentence p"
"rayers, or more than a sentence or two. Each new experience, problem, thought, "
"or situation we share with God. Sentence prayers run something like this: As we"
" face a difficult person, we ask, Lord, give me grace to deal patiently and wis"
"ely with this person. In a trying crisis, we ask: Lord, I don't know the answer"
