"	To be prayerless, we have seen, is to claim autonomy from God. The prayer"

"	Whenever a man is ruled by a spirit of autonomy, he is then capable essen"
"tially of self prayer only. He worries, frets, and cudgels his brains in order "
"to ferret out the secret of salvation within himself. Our Lord spoke to the hea"
"rt of all anxiety when He said, "Which of you by taking thought can add one cub"
"it unto his stature?" (Matt. 6:27). Autonomy is marked by anxiety. Existentiali"
"sm thus has much to say about the role of anxiety in the life of man, because a"
"nxiety is the mark of autonomy. Anxiety seeks to do what only God can do, to pe"
"rform miracles and to govern by acts of providence the course of human affairs."
" Worry and anxiety are the marks of prayerlessness; they mark the man who seeks"
" to be the master of his own fate, and the captain of his own soul. All too man"
"y anxious people and chronic worriers try to pass themselves off as superior an"
"d sensitive souls when they are in fact godless ones. The alternative to prayer"
" is anxiety and worry."

"	To be prayerless is to regard ourselves as autonomous, and to believe, im"
"plicitly or explicitly, in our autonomy is to deny the doctrine of creation. Sc"
"ripture is clear that the triune God made all things by His sovereign word in s"
"ix days (Gen. 1). The doctrine of creation is clearly tied to prayer. The pract"

"	Because we are God's creation, the whole of our being, and all our days, "
"past, present, and future, are inseparable from His sovereign decree, purpose, "
"and word. When we deny that He is the only Lord and Creator, we deny that He ca"
"n be the governor and the redeemer of our lives. We then separate ourselves fro"
"m life. The penalty for sin is death (Gen. 2:17; Rom. 6:23). To seek autonomy a"
"nd independence from God is to hate God and to love death (Prov. 8:36). It is t"
"he essence of sin to declare that man is his own god, knowing or determining fo"
"r himself what constitutes good and evil (Gen. 3:5). On the other hand, the red"
"eemed of God know themselves to be God's creation and re-creation, the Lord's p"
"ossession and his handiwork. Instead of seeking independence, they manifest rat"
"her by prayer and the totality of their faith, obedience, and life their depend"
"ence upon God. Instead of being prayerless, they are prayerful."

" stress the essential ingredients of prayer, citing praise, thanksgiving, petit"

" our ideas, reactions, delights, and concerns. Our conversation does not start "
"and stop: it is continual, although there can be time gaps of many minutes in b"
"etween words. So too with prayer. The heart of prayer is dependence and communi"
"on. If we enjoy that dependence and communion, we pray at all times, sentence p"
"rayers, or more than a sentence or two. Each new experience, problem, thought, "
"or situation we share with God. Sentence prayers run something like this: As we"
" face a difficult person, we ask, Lord, give me grace to deal patiently and wis"
"ely with this person. In a trying crisis, we ask: Lord, I don't know the answer"
"s; please, help me, and give me wisdom. In a happy setting, we thank Him; if so"
