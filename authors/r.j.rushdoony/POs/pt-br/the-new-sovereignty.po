msgid "After 1660, the foundations of Western culture began to shift away from Christi"
"anity. This was a resumption of a trend which began in the late middle ages and"
" resulted in the Renaissance. The new, humanistic culture of the Enlightenment "
"was primarily a culture of the court, of intellectuals, artists, and some of th"
"e clergy. This dominant culture did not reach into the lower classes except to "
"impoverish them religiously and economically, so that eighteenth-century people"
"s were on a very low, neglected, and debased level."

msgid "The explosion which affected all classes was the French Revolution, which insis"
"ted on a new foundation and a new creed for all men. As surely as St. Dominic a"
"nd Francis had been reformers, and, later, Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, and Loyola,"
" so too the revolutionary leaders were reformers, but of a different kind. As O"
"tto Scott noted, they did not begin by reforming themselves: "they expected to "
"reform others."1 This was a major break with Christendom. In pagan antiquity, r"
"eform had meant the imposition of the will of a man or a group on all society. "
"Gaius Marius (157-86 BC) craved justice for Rome with a great intensity, for ex"
"ample, but he had, as G.P. Baker noted, no doctrine of original sin. His soluti"
"on was to see evil in others and then to destroy them in order to save Rome.2 M"
"arius as a result had no patience nor interest in the ordinary legal processes "
"of civil life. Instead, he bypassed them to gain quick "reform" and "justice." "
"This meant the sack of Rome, corpses in the streets, the ravishing of the wives"
" and children of all his enemies, and the pillaging of their properties. Marius"
"'s fretfulness over injustice made him a monster of vengeance.3 Because the Rom"
"ans had no transcendental doctrine of sovereignty, lordship inevitably belonged"
" to the state and its ruler."

msgid "In the French Revolution, Robespierre could declare in the Assembly, "The Peopl"
"e are the Law," and hence the sovereign.4 In practice, this meant, in terms of "
"Rousseau, that the general will of the people was made manifest in the people's"
" voice, Robespierre. Because reason was sovereign, and Reason, the attribute of"
" man, did not come into its own in the common man but rather in the general wil"
"l and its elite voice, Robespierre was thus the sovereign, the voice of Reason,"
" and the voice of Virtue. Fouche and d'Herbois set forth an edict which sums up"
" the spirit of revolutions: "All is permitted those who act in the Revolutionar"

"nic Wars and their impact on all of Europe, was its effect on the universities."
" This in itself was one of the most far-reaching of all revolutions.6 Before th"
"e French Revolution, despite the presence of Enlightenment scholars, the univer"
"sity was still what some term "medieval." This means that its basic orientation"
" was still formally theological. The triune God, His enscriptured and revealed "
"word, and the ordained order of creation, were seen as the object of study, the"
" ultimate source of knowledge, and the focus for all learning. Although the sta"
"te had previously funded its universities in many cases, the state still saw it"
"self and its universities as formally under God. The slow erosion of the theolo"
"gical foundations of society and learning were greatly stepped up by the French"
" Revolution."

msgid "The university began to shift from a theological to a civil foundation, and Ger"
"many led the way. Scholars like Kant, Humboldt, Fichte, Hegel, Savigny, Schleie"
"rmacher, and others began to remake the university. It was now a civil agency, "
"and the focus of the university and its learning was not on God but on the stat"
"e. In 1492, Columbus, by his discovery of the Americas, gave centrality to an a"
"lready developing era of exploration. There was a new world for man to explore "
"and conquer. The French Revolution in its own way opened up what to many was an"
" even more important new world, a man-centered world. The focal point of societ"
"y was now not God but either man or the state."

msgid "A major consequence of this was its impact on the meaning of salvation. Whereas"
" for orthodox Christianity salvation means regeneration by God's grace with the"
" forgiveness of sins through Christ's atonement, for revolutionary men it means"
" the change of political and economic systems by means of a political gospel. S"
"in is identified with those who uphold the "old order," i.e., Christianity, a r"
"espect for orderly legal processes, justice as God's revealed law, and so on. K"
"nowledge is no longer tied to God's order, or to any objective order: "knowledg"
"e merely reflects power." It is a social construct of a class in power. Revolut"
"ionary knowledge means the denial of truth to anything other than the revolutio"
"nary creed. Within the church, this means liberation theology, which means that"
" where revolutionists declare themselves to be the voice of an ostensibly oppre"
"ssed group, the revolutionists and their views constitute virtue and knowledge."
" In place of the Biblical doctrine of sin, the revolutionists hold to a "belief"
" that the evil of this world is unique to a political system, and can be overco"
"me by political action on behalf of a rival social order." This view marks huma"
"nists and Marxists alike. It means, "Morality is that which serves to destroy t"
"he old exploiting society." For Christianity, salvation means faith in the aton"
"ement of Jesus Christ; there is then reconciliation with God. The new faith has"
" no reconciliation, only annihilation. Salvation is only for the revolutionary "
"party; all others must, like demons, be exorcised.7 This exorcism we see in all"
" its murderous intensity in Marxist states; in other states, the drift is in th"
"e same direction. For modern man increasingly, like Gaius Marius of old Rome, e"
"vil is in other men, in the opposition, and the solution is to destroy them. La"
"cking any sense of either the depravity of man or the sovereignty of God, moder"
"n man sees himself as sovereign and other men as fallen and evil."
