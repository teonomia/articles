"		Tyranny is man’s rule without God, and it is obviously very popular beca"
"use it is so common. Men may complain about it, but they obviously prefer it to"
" its alternatives. Rule without God is preferred by many because they find God’"
"s government to be too obtrusive. This is an article of faith with them because"
", as sinners, God’s government makes them fearful of discovery and judgment. Mo"
"re than once I have seen immoral priests and pastors well regarded by their par"
"ishioners, who feel then easier in their own sins. They will turn on their chur"
"ch leader only when his exposure embarrasses them.\n"
"		If freedom were as muc"
"h loved as men profess to love it, we would see much more of it in history. Men"
" find it convenient to honor things they do not want because the claim to virtu"
"e is easier than the practice of it. Pretense is a basic characteristic of fall"
"en man.\n"
"		What God’s law offers is freedom from man. Man’s law has always b"
"een one expanding claim to power over man. God’s law, however, requires virtue,"
" whereas man’s law simply calls for moral behavior. In fact, Leviticus 20:7-8 s"
"ays plainly:\n"
"		7. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am t"
"he LORD your God.\n"
"		8. And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the"
" LORD which sanctify you.\n"
"		However, for some strange reason too many schol"
"ars, theologians, and pastors go, not to the Bible, but to one or another confe"
"ssional standard when they discuss the law. As a result, they too often say not"
"hing about God’s purpose with the law: holiness.\n"
"		What churchmen fail to s"
"ee, the ungodly clearly recognize. God’s law requires holiness whereas man’s la"
"w requires conformity. Throughout history, man’s law has at times legislated ag"
"ainst adultery, as does God’s law, but with a difference. Adultery can be viewe"
"d as an offense against the husband or wife, against the state, or against God."
" God’s law is theocentric, not man-centered. It is therefore a matter of holine"
"ss.\n"
"		In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus condemns lusting after another woma"
"n as committing adultery with her in one’s heart (Matt. 5:27-28). In statist la"
"w, adultery may or may not be a legal offense, but certainly lusting in one’s h"
"eart is not. This is because the Biblical premise of the law is that sin is bas"
"ic to lawlessness, whereas no such idea undergirds statist law. The goal of God"
"’s law is that it can be written in our hearts and become our new nature (Jer. "
"31:33; Ezek. 36:25-29). The goal of God’s law is in man’s regeneration, whereas"
" statist law aims simply to conformity."

"	Holiness means a separation and a consecration to God. We are summoned to"

"	In this light, the law has a radically different meaning. The law is God’"

"	The early “legislative” bodies of America were know by such names as the "
