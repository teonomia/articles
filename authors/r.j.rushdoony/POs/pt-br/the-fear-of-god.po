"	Robert L. Cate is right in stating that God came near to Israel in order "
"to prove or test them, something basic to all of Exodus.2 Israel was afraid, an"
"d fear can be good and healthy, but it can also be evil. “The true fear of God "
"is to be the desire to avoid sin rather than to avoid the consequences of sin.”"
"3 Moses refers to this distinction with respect to fear in v. 20."

"	The people asked Moses to be their mediator with God. They wanted no dire"
"ct confrontation with God. In itself, there was nothing wrong with their reques"
"t, but it was apparently motivated by a desire not to be too close to God, “les"
"t we die” (v. 19). Again, this could have a favorable meaning. However, later e"
"vents make it clear that they preferred a remoteness to God because God’s coven"
"ant and law were not in their hearts. Because their hearts were far from Him, t"

"	Fear is a necessary aspect of man’s life. Fears can be real or imagined, "
