"	The judgment on the Tower of Babel builders should concern us all, becaus"
"e it is a continuing judgment on all their imitators. The Tower represented a o"
"ne-world governmental center in defiance of God. Its purpose was to undo God’s "
"judgment and to restore paradise by man’s ostensibly sovereign acts."

"	God’s judgment on Babel was preceded by His commentary on that endeavor. "
"First, God noted their unity in sin: “the people is one, and they have all one "
"language” (Gen. 11:6). They were at work in unity to defy God. In Sumerian, the"
" Tower is called Etemenanki, “House of the foundation of heaven and earth.” Man"
" hoped to bind all historical determination to himself, to assume control in ef"
"fect of heaven and earth.1"

msgid "Second, God said, “this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained fr"
"om them, which they have imagined to do” (Gen. 11:6). Their plan is the control"
" of the world by man, man as lord over man in a unified one-world order. Such a"
"n order would rivet man into slavery to man, God’s purpose is the shaking of me"
"n and nations (Heb. 12:18-29). The world is therefore founded upon the seas and"
" established upon the floods to prevent us from gaining a security in our sin ("
"Ps. 24:2)."

" God declares, “Go to, let us go down” (Gen. 11:5,7). These idioms have referen"

" of a parent “coming down” on a child in punishment. The usage here is similar:"
" it has reference to taking action."

"nd confused; men were scattered over the face of the earth by the internal diss"
"ension God’s judgment created. The word confound is in the Hebrew balal, to mix"
" or mingle. God confounded man in his sin, and God continues to do so. In Babyl"
"onian, Babel means the “gate of god”, but in Hebrew it came to mean confusion."

"	Let us look again at the work involved in building the Tower of Babel. It"
" was a major task and involved no small amount of labor. Before the Flood, citi"
"es were commonplace, but Babel was different in that it represented no normal u"
"rban development but a planned operation to create a world center. It was thus "
"not productive work. It produced neither food, house, nor manufactured goods. I"
"ts purpose was to defy God by preventive planning against God’s judgment and la"

"	The Tower of Babel was destroyed by God’s judgment, but the motivation of"

"	Thirty years ago, as the new pastor of a church, I ended the every-member"
" canvassing of members to finance the church. I did so because I believed that "
"the motivation for giving should be a willing heart, and I quietly worked towar"
"ds stressing tithing. The result was that the giving increased substantially. A"
"t the same time, denominational opposition to this was marked, as well as the o"
"utright hostility of some of the elders. The important thing, it was held by th"
"ese men, was not so much the results, i.e., the income or giving, but the metho"
"d. Indeed, some insisted on believing that the Spirit worked best with the meth"
"od."

"	The reasons were obvious. Those churchmen involved in the every-member vi"
"sitation work were of two kinds. Some found it difficult or embarrassing to pre"
"ssure members to give more. Others enjoyed doing so. It gave them an opportunit"
"y to badger people sanctimoniously, give them feelings of guilt and inadequacy,"
" and to do so with a self-righteous glow. It was the exercise of power which ap"
"pealed to them."

"	To me, the whole system was a trust in man’s way rather than in God’s law"

"	The two are essentially the same. Ungodly work is useless work, and vice "
"versa. Consider the very considerable internecine conflict in many organization"
"s, institutions, and corporations. Such conflict is productive of nothing excep"
"t more conflict. It represents a power play, a Tower of Babel syndrome, seeking"
" a top which “may reach unto heaven” (Gen. 11:4), or, as Cassuto rendered it, “"
"with its top in the heavens.”2 At the very least, this means the Tower was buil"
"t to glorify man, to create an imposing and impressive center. Davidson’s comme"
"nt is to the point: “Man unites in the anthem ‘Glory to man in the highest’ and"
" the outcome is division and confusion.” However, even as man glorifies himself"
", he is fearful of God. “In the fear which prompts this action or we shall be d"
"ispersed all over the earth (verse 4) there is symbolized man’s feverish search"
" for security apart from God, a search doomed to failure.”3"

"	The Tower was a fiat effort. It was an attempt by man to play god, and al"
"l activity outside of God’s dominion. We are then attempting to evade the world"
" of God’s law. The politics, economics, religions, and sciences of our time are"
" dedicated to man’s fiat will. They are all thus examples of the Babel mentalit"
"y. The work Babel created led only to disaster. The work created by contemporar"
"y politico-economic activities is similarly doomed. The loans to the many incom"
"petent regimes to continue their incompetence, the world-wide fiat money inflat"
"ion, and the increasingly controlled work in every sector of life are all disas"
"ter-bound. Revelation 13:17 tells us of the goal of this humanistic effort: “th"
"at no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark or the name of the beast"
", or the number of his name.” For predestination by God, the new Babel, Babylon"
" the Great (Rev. 17:5), substitutes predestination by the humanistic state. Whe"
"reas under God’s predestination, our “labour is not in vain in the Lord” (I Cor"
". 15:58), in the state’s predestination it is always vain."
