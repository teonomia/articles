msgid "In London, England, a 10 year old girl was taken from her mother by a juvenile "
"court. According to the Santa Barbara New-Press, March 4, 1966, "The child's on"
"ly offense is to wipe her knife and fork with a table napkin before meals." Bec"
"ause the girl persisted, and the head-master barred her from "the school cantee"
"n," the mother "refused to send her to school" The child was then taken at once"
" from the mother. Whether the child or mother were right or wrong is irrelevant"
": The central issue is the destruction by the state of a family. The normal pro"
"cedure in such cases has been "a small fine." In this case, the state asserted "
"its power to declare implicitly that any resistance to its will constitutes del"
"inquency, and therefore the home must be broken. The state thus becomes the "tr"
"ue" parent of the child. The authority of the family is abolished by the author"

"1966, noted, "Last July the Department of Interior announced plans to offer rec"
"ordable contracts to Imperial Valley farmers served by the All American Canal u"
"nder which they would be required to dispose of holdings in excess of 160 acres"
". Now the department has asked the Department of Justice to file court action t"
"o enforce that limitation." This is the most recent development in a federal pr"
"ogram which began in 1902. Its legal history is a tangled one. Even in terms of"
" its own laws, the federal action is illegal. The purpose of this action is in "
"effect "agrarian reform", the socialistic confiscation of private lands. Suppos"
"edly, the action is to favor small holdings, but no small farm is secure if the"
" federal power to confiscate is admitted. If this step is morally valid, then t"
"he federal government also has the right to declare that a house with more than"
" three bedrooms, or more than six rooms, cannot receive power until it is "shar"
"ed" with someone else. The principle is exactly the same: it is theft by social"
"istic confiscation. The fact that the "law" is used to steal only makes the act"
" more immoral."
