"	Problems often cannot be answered or resolved because the problem itself "
"is never clearly recognized. Too often, attempts to formulate a problem preclud"
"e an answer. A classic example of this is the so-called problem of free will. T"
"he question of free will can never be resolved until it is recognized that beca"
"use man is a secondary cause, i.e., he is not God, his will can only have a sec"
"ondary, conditioned, and contingent freedom. Man is not free to decide the time"
" of his birth nor his race or sex, nor can he choose to grow younger instead of"
" older. At every point his life is circumscribed, and he himself is a consequen"
"ce of many causes. God alone has absolute and primary freedom. When we recogniz"
"e that man is a secondary cause and not capable of an absolute or primary free "
"will, then it is possible for us to define secondary freedom and to understand "
"the nature of man's will. Until then, the problem of free will cannot be define"
"d or understood because it has not been formulated for understanding and resolu"
"tion."

"	Wilson's historical summary of the six phases of the problem is a good on"
"e, although his analysis of the most recent phase, since World War I, can be se"
"riously argued. The development can be simplified to three basic phases: first,"
" there was, in the colonial period, a policy of establishment. A single church,"
" or sometimes more than one denomination in a state, was established and financ"
"ially supported by the state. The second phase began also in the colonial perio"
"d, the disestablishment of churches and the establishment of Christianity as a "
"religion (i.e., a religious rather than an ecclesiastical establishment). The U"
"nited States was held to be a Christian nation, with no church given any legal "
"status over another. The third phase, which developed rapidly after World War I"
" but began after the Civil War, insists on an ostensible neutrality of the stat"
"e towards religion with religious liberty for the churches. Wilson's documentat"
"ion of the history of the American development is an able one, but it tends to "
"overlook the basic issue."

"	The medieval formulation of the problem is still with us, and to view the"
" tension in traditional "Church-State" terms, as Wilson does, is to miss the co"
"ntemporary problem and to revert to a now obsolete imperial papal debate. The p"
"apacy and the empire, as well as the papacy in conflict with the nations, sough"
"t to institutionalize the problem. Both parties were agreed that a Christian or"
"der was a necessity. True, individual rulers at times were hostile to such an o"
"rder, and Frederick II clearly had a non-Christian order in mind, but for the m"
"ost part, the issue was not a Christian versus a pagan order, but who should ha"
"ve predominance and priority in the control and maintenance of a Christian soci"
"al order. This, historically, is the "Church-State" problem. Increasingly, the "
""Church-State" problem in this sense is either marginal, irrelevant, or non-exi"
"stent in the modern era. First, the state is less concerned with furthering a C"
"hristian social order and is often hostile to it. In brief, the state has simpl"
"y walked away from this historic problem of Christendom. Second, less and less "
"is there a single church in any Western country claiming the right of establish"
"ment. In some countries where an established church exists, there is no support"
" for that church from tax funds, and no legal recognition of Christian order in"
" the courts, while a control remains over the appointment of bishops and other "
"church officers. In no historic sense is the ancient struggle between Church an"
"d State for priority in a social order a problem in modern society. Third, ther"
"e is no agreement on either the ecclesiastical or civil fronts that a Christian"
" social order is the necessary one. Very often, there is a general assent to a "
"claimed and supposed "neutrality" on the part of the state. Fourth, increasingl"
"y, religious liberty is being replaced by religious toleration. The difference "
"is very important. Religious liberty has meant, historically, the freedom of th"
"e church and of the believer in his worship from state control and jurisdiction"
". It has meant that the state cannot interfere in a sphere where it has no auth"
"ority nor jurisdiction any more than it can interfere with the internal affairs"
" of a foreign power. Religious toleration has meant that the state claims the r"
"ight to govern and control religion and to declare which church or which religi"
"on has the right to exist. Religious toleration places the power in the hands o"
"f the state. The original constitutional pattern was religious liberty, not tol"
"eration. It should be added, moreover, that the original constitutional settlem"
"ent did not propose a "separation of Church and State," although that phrase is"
" increasingly used by the courts to sum up the constitutional position.3 Becaus"
"e all the states had their own religious settlements or establishments, the Fir"
"st Amendment simply barred Congress or the Federal Government from entering int"
"o an area where jurisdiction was reserved to the states. The states had the rig"
"ht to make such establishments or settlements as they or their subordinate bodi"
"es, the counties and cities, chose to make. Only after the Fourteenth Amendment"
" was interpreted by the Supreme Court to apply to all states was there a denial"
" of the power of the states to make such establishments.4 To return to the so-c"
"alled problem of "Church and State," there is no possibility of any resolution "
"of the basic issue until the question is properly formulated. To speak of a chu"
"rch and state problem is to foreclose any solution."

"	What then is the basic problem? Not only is every church a religious inst"
"itution, but every state or social order is a religious establishment. Every st"
"ate is a law order, and every law order represents an enacted morality, with pr"
"ocedures for the enforcement of that morality. Every morality represents a form"
" of theological order, i.e., is an aspect and expression of a religion. The chu"
"rch thus is not the only religious institution; the state also is a religious i"
"nstitution. More often than the church, the state has been the central religiou"
"s institution of most civilizations through the centuries. The war between the "
"Roman Empire and the early church was a religious warfare, a struggle between t"
"wo claimants who represented rival religions and wanted to order society in ter"
"ms of their faith.5 The claims of each faith were total claims, as all religiou"
"s claims are. Thus, American Puritans held that the Bible is "the revealed trut"
"h and the source of all reason and morality."6 Similarly, humanists today belie"
"ve that the affirmation of the autonomy of man and his mind constitutes the sou"
"rce of all true reason and morality."

"	To return to the basic problem today, the real issue is not between churc"
"h and state, but is simply this: the state as a religious establishment has pro"
"gressively disestablished Christianity as its law foundation, and, while profes"
"sing neutrality, has in fact established humanism as the religion of the state."
" When the religion of a people changes, its laws inevitably reflect that change"
" and conform themselves to the new faith and the new morality.7 There has been "
"deception on the part of the courts, by their profession of religious neutralit"
"y, as they have substituted one religion for another, humanism for Christianity"
". The basic reason, however, has been the theological collapse of the churches,"
" and this has been true of all of them. In the dominant evangelical circles, th"
"is collapse came first. Hudson has referred to this as "the deeper malady,. . ."
" .the theological erosion which had taken place during the nineteenth century.""
" In evangelicalism, "Doctrinal definitions tended to be neglected in the stress"
" that was placed upon ‘heart religion' and the ‘conversion experience'."8 This "
"theological collapse led to the untenable belief in religious neutralism and to"
" the surrender of Christian schools for statist education. As a result, humanis"
"m became the established religion of state and school, and, by infiltration, of"
" the churches as well."
