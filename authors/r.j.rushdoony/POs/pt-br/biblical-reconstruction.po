" means, first, that this Kingdom must govern us, our institutions (including ch"
"urch and state), our vocations, activities, arts, sciences, families, ourselves"
", and all things else. There is no sphere, area, nor even an atom in all creati"
"on outside this Kingdom and its absolute government."
