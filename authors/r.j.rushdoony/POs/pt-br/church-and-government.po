msgid "One of the more serious examples of false or muddled thinking today is with a r"
"egard to the use of the words “church” and “government.” When people say “gover"
"nment,” they usually mean the state or federal government, and nothing could be"
" more false. The Puritans knew better. The state for them was “civil government"
".”"

msgid "Government meant first of all the self-government of the Christian man. There i"
"s no more basic and important government in society than that. Government also "
"means the family, a very important area of rule and authority. It means the sch"
"ool, which governs the early lives of people, and it means also the church, a v"
"ery essential area of government."

"e among many, not the only one, and the most important government of all in hum"
"an society (other than God’s) is self-government."

msgid "The same misuse appears with the word “church.” We usually mean by that word a "
"religious institution, a denomination, or sometimes a building. The church, how"
"ever, is first of all the mystical body of Christ, the true, living, and supern"
"atural congregation of all the redeemed in time and in eternity. It is thus far"
" greater than our church or its local building."

msgid "In any case, if we limit the meanings of church and government to an institutio"
"n and a state, we have not only misused those words but also limited and impove"
"rished our lives. Instead of seeing ourselves as the basic government in human "
"society, we have handed over our lives to the civil government. We are the gove"
"rnment, each in our conduct of our lives under God. To forget that is to take t"
"he road to slavery."

msgid "Moreover, the true church is first and last Jesus Christ Himself and every part"
"icular congregation insofar as it is faithful and obedient to Him. To limit the"
" church to an institution is to put ourselves out of communion with Him who is "
"the church."

msgid "The way we use these words tells us much about our time. A man speaks out of hi"
"s heart and faith, and we have been trusting too much in things present, things"

"keth in his heart, so is he” (Prov. 23:7)."
