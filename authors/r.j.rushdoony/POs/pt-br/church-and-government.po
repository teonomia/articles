msgid "One of the more serious examples of false or muddled thinking today is with a r"
"egard to the use of the words “church” and “government.” When people say “gover"
"nment,” they usually mean the state or federal government, and nothing could be"
" more false. The Puritans knew better. The state for them was “civil government"
".”"

"s no more basic and important government in society than that. Government also "
"means the family, a very important area of rule and authority. It means the sch"

msgid "The same misuse appears with the word “church.” We usually mean by that word a "
"religious institution, a denomination, or sometimes a building. The church, how"
"ever, is first of all the mystical body of Christ, the true, living, and supern"
"atural congregation of all the redeemed in time and in eternity. It is thus far"
" greater than our church or its local building."

msgid "In any case, if we limit the meanings of church and government to an institutio"
"n and a state, we have not only misused those words but also limited and impove"

"society, we have handed over our lives to the civil government. We are the gove"
"rnment, each in our conduct of our lives under God. To forget that is to take t"
