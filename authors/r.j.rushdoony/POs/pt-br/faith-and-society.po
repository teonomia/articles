msgid "At the beginning of the 17th century, Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish thinkers"
" were agreed on one thing, the necessity for godly rule and for a godly concept"
" of society: they disagreed on what the specific nature of that rule should be."
" By the end of the 17th century, men in all three groups had come to accept the"
" idea of secular, humanistic rule, of a society built on a social contract, wit"
"h, not faith but self-preservation as the key. The purpose of religion was now "
"seen as a duty to convert men and make them moral, but to leave the rest of lif"
"e to secular man. The inner world belonged to God, it was held, but the outer w"
"orld was a neutral realm at best. The men of the early 17th century saw religio"
"n not only as conversion and morality but also as godly rule in every area of l"
"ife. By the end of the 19th century, the secular world began to feel the necess"
"ity of claiming the inner world also. Freud insisted that the whole of the supp"
"osedly spiritual realm was a product of the unconscious and within the province"
" of humanistic science. The problem of guilt was also made a scientific rather "
"than a religious concern. (See R. J. Rushdoony: Freud. Nutley, New Jersey: The "
"Craig Press, 1965, 1972.) Religion itself began to turn more rapidly into anoth"
"er area of humanistic thought and to surrender its theological character."
