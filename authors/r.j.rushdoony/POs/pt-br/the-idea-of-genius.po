msgid "The idea of Genius is an important but too little studied aspect of Western his"
"tory; it is an important pagan concept which still governs our thinking. We can"
" begin to understand what genius means if we recognize that it is basically the"
" same word as the Arabic jinn or genie. -lhe word genius comes from the Latin, "
"and the idea is Roman, but it is hard to distinguish it at times from the Arabi"
"c idea, because the two are so similar."

msgid "The idea of genius comes out of pagan animism and ancestor worship. The genius "
"of a family, house, group, or state was the protecting, guiding, inspiring supe"
"rnatural spirit which took care of it and was also the object of its worship. A"
"ll good Romans therefore worshipped "the genius of Rome." "The genius of Rome" "
"was the divine power protecting Rome, the Roman mission, Rome itself ("divine R"
"ome"), and its heroic leaders and emperors. Godlike men were believed to receiv"
"e from the gods a special destiny above that of ordinary mortals. These men bec"
"ame the Lares or genius for their time."

msgid "With the coming of Christianity, the idea of genius receded, as did the related"
" Greek idea of the hero. The hero was a great protector of men who was descende"
"d from the gods, or born of a god, and he was worshipped as a god after His dea"
"th. Because Biblical faith makes a sharp and clear distinction between God and "
"man, between the uncreated and divine Being of God, and the created and creatur"
"ely being of men, the idea of the genius (and of the hero) was for some time in"
" the background. With the revival of Greek philosophy, of Aristotle and of Plat"
"o, the idea of the genius again came to the fore, especially with the Renaissan"
"ce. The hero or divine leader of men came to be a leader of the state. The Lead"
"er or Hero now became a commanding and totalitarian figure. The Genius, the man"
" with divine powers of insight and guidance, came to be the artist. Previously,"
" in Christian Europe, the artist was not an artist in the modern sense. He was "
"a craftsman, an artisan, and a businessman who was a specialist in his field. ("
"In recent years, one composer, Igor Stravinsky, specifically denied being an ar"
"tist in the modern sense and saw himself as an old-fashioned semi-Christian art"
"isan, an opinion for which he was widely attacked.) The Christian artisan did h"
"is work like any other skilled specialist, without any pretensions. With the Re"
"naissance, the artist was not only regarded as a man of genius, but also called"
" by extravagant names, "the divine Aretino", "the divine Michelangelo", and so "
"on."

msgid "But this was not all. In paganism, the genius had been essentially a political "
"figure in the developed form of the idea of genius. The medieval artisan was es"
"sentially related to the faith, and his greatest work was in the church. After "
"the Renaissance, the artist associated himself increasingly with the state. The"
" church continued to be a great patron of art, and, in the following eras, such"
" creations as baroque church art certainly represented very great outlays of mo"
"ney, but artists found their chief voice and their best self-expression in work"

" next step of evolution. His attitude is pragmatic, not dogmatic. He has his ro"

"to sin in order to further his cause. As Bentley summarized Carlyle's view, "Th"

"the genius was worshipped, and, in the person of the emperor, ruled. By the 183"

"genius: "everything is permitted to men of intelligence." (Cesar Grana: Bohemia"
"n versus Bourgeois, p. 47. New York: Basic Books , 1964.) Their hatred of the n"
"ormal world was so great that one writer of that era said, "I would give half m"
"y talents to be a bastard." (Ibid., p. 145.) In his excellent study of Sartre, "
"Molnar has shown how the idea of bastard and intellectual came to be identified"
"; the bastard-intellectual is a heroic outlaw at war with middle class society "
"and culture, deliberately at odds with normal, well-integrated people. (Thomas "
"Molnar: Sartre: Ideologue of Our Times, pp. 5ff. New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 196"
