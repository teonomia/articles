"	Last Saturday, while travelling to Los Angeles, I listened on my car radi"
"o to an evangelist broadcasting from the other end of the country. While claimi"
"ng to preach the word of God as a Bible-believing Christian, he preached a fait"
"h I could not recognize as Scriptural, nor the God I hear speak in the Bible. T"
"his man assured his converted and unconverted listeners that "God is always on "
"your side." He also spoke of God as our "Daddy" in heaven, rich in resources an"
"d eager and anxious to help us if we only would allow Him to do so. I could not"
" recognize in what he preached the sovereign God of Scripture nor anything that"
" resembled His commanding word, the Bible. The evangelist was a humanist who wa"
"s using, or trying to use, God as the greatest possible resource available to m"
"an; central to his thinking was man and man's needs. He lacked any systematic t"
"heology of God; instead, there were traces in his brief message of a theology o"
"f man as the true center and the god of things."

"	Very briefly, systematic theology says that God is God. It declares that,"
" because God is sovereign, omnipotent, all-wise, all-holy, and knows from etern"
"ity all that He ordains and decrees, therefore there is no hidden possibility o"
"r potentiality in God, but that God is both fully self-conscious and totally se"
"lf-consistent. Only with such a God is systematic theology possible. Wherever f"
"aith in the sovereignty of God declines, there too systematic theology goes int"
"o an eclipse."

"	The word systematic in systematic theology means, among other things, fir"
"st, that it is a comprehensive, unified statement of what Scripture as a whole "
"teaches about God. The revelation of God in Scripture is brought together in su"
"mmary and comprehensive form, and the results of Biblical theology, the exegesi"
"s and analysis of Scripture and its meaning, are organized and set forth."

"	Second, the word systematic means that the totally sovereign God, who doe"
"s not change (Mal. 3:6), is truly knowable. He is always the same. Men change c"
"haracter, grow and regress, but God is always the same, totally self-consistent"
" and absolutely sovereign. Only about such a God is a systematic word possible."
" This is why modern theology cannot produce systematics. Karl Barth's position "
"was a denial of the possibility of systematics. Thus, he wrote,"

"	But it is not "the Almighty" who is God; we cannot understand from the st"
"andpoint of a supreme concept of power, who God is. And the man who calls "the "
"Almighty" God misses God in the most terrible way. For the "Almighty" is bad, a"
"s "power in itself" is bad. The "Almighty" means Chaos, Evil, the Devil. We cou"
"ld not better describe and define the Devil than by trying to think this idea o"
"f a self-based, free, sovereign ability....God and "power in itself" are mutual"

"essence of the impossible.1"

"	Barth's God is not the God of Scripture who declares, "I am the Almighty "
"God" (Gen. 17:1). Barth's God is a limiting concept, the product of a man's ima"

"	Similarly, Haroutunian held that systematic theology was impossible, beca"
"use such a doctrine of God cannot do "justice to the complexities of human life"
"."2 The center of Haroutunian's theology is human life: the God of Scripture ca"
"nnot in any degree nor in any sense impinge on the sovereignty of autonomous ma"
"n. Hence, for him systematic theology is an illusion,3 because the God of syste"
"matic theology is by definition excluded from all consideration."

msgid "Third, systematic means that the presupposition of theology is not the mind of "
"autonomous man but the sovereign God of Scripture. Systematics, no more than ap"
"ologetics, seeks to prove God and His existence; rather, it presupposes the tri"
"une God as the only ground and means of reasoning and proof. As Van Til has so "
"excellently demonstrated, "All the disciplines must presuppose God, but at the "
"same time presupposition is the best proof."4 On any other presupposition, if l"
"ogically applied, no proof is at all possible, because all reality is reduced t"
"o brute factuality, as Van Til has shown.5 Instead of brute and meaningless fac"
"tuality, all the universe gives us God-created factuality only, and hence the n"
"ecessary presupposition of all thinking is the triune God."

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "Fourth, as Van Til has always stressed, systematics denies the concept of neutr"
"ality. There are no neutral facts, no neutral thoughts, no neutral man nor reas"
"on. All men, facts, and thinking either begin with the sovereign and triune God"
", or they begin with rebellion against Him. Systematics affirms that God; the d"
"enial of systematics is a denial of God."

msgid "Fifth, systematics is necessary if men are to think intelligently and logically"
". Without the concept of systematics and the God it sets forth, we cannot hold "
"to a rational and understandable universe nor to any meaningful order therein. "
"Unregenerate man's reason and logic operate against the background of chaos and"
" a meaningless void, so that reason and logic are in essence more than irration"
"al: they are absurd. Systematics not only makes reason reasonable, but it decla"
"res that there is a necessary and meaningful connection between all facts, beca"
"use all facts are the creation of the sovereign and omnipotent God and are thus"
" revelations of His purpose and order. The idea of preaching the whole counsel "
"of God is only a possibility if systematics is a reality. Otherwise, there is n"
"o necessary and real connection and unity in the word of God, and we have inste"
"ad a developing, changing word and plan under different dispensations. We have "
"then a fragmented word, not a whole counsel which is a necessary and authoritat"
"ive unity."

"	Thus, without systematics there is no word of God, and, indeed, no such G"
"od as His revelation in Scripture sets forth. We have then another god with an "
"occasional word which is made up of flashes of insight, and of superior powers "
"to man, but no absolute, almighty, and sovereign God whose every word is infall"
"ible, and whose revelation manifests the only possible system of truth. This li"
"ving God declares, "I am God, and there is none else" (Isa. 46:9). There is no "
"other God, no other truth, no other possibility, system, or meaning outside of "
"Him. He is God the Lord."
