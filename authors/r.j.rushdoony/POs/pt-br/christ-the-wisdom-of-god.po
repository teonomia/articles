"	St. Paul, in I Corinthians 1:24 declares Christ to be “the power of God, "
"and the wisdom of God.” Modernist commentators somehow try to make this text me"
"an something other than it plainly reads, and to question whether Christ is cal"
"led the power of God, and the wisdom of God. Their quibbling need not trouble u"
"s (Prov. 26:4). Wisdom (sophia) is in its absolute sense an attribute of God. T"
"otal wisdom and knowledge belong to God alone. To declare Christ to be “the wis"
"dom of God” is to declare Him to be in Himself God, the second person of the Go"
"dhead. Jesus Christ is the revelation of God, God incarnate."

"	At this point, by way of contrast, it is of value to contrast Christ as w"
"isdom, the wisdom of God (cf. Col. 2:3), with Satan, the tempter or serpent of "
"Genesis 3:1, nachash in the Hebrew. This serpent is identified as Satan in Reve"
"lation 12:9, 14,15; 20:2. In the verb, the meaning of nachash is to hiss, whisp"
"er, foretell. The word is one among many in Scripture used for serpents. The me"
"aning of foretell or divine comes from the silent or hissing aspect of the serp"
"ent, and its hidden nature, i.e., hidden in grass and bushes. The word of all o"
"ccultists is such a word, dark, hidden, and not clearly spoken. Satan thus is o"
"ne who offers the occult word or “wisdom” so called. It is an insinuated word, "
"a hissed and whispered word, a “possible” word, never the sure word. Astrologer"
"s are given to asserting that the stars indicate but do not determine. Occult “"
"knowledge” is prone to speak so. It speaks about the future apart from God as a"
" possible future."

"endered as divineth. In Leviticus 19:26, it is enchantment. In Deut. 18:10, an "
"enchanter is nachash. In I Kings 20:33, nachash is translated as “diligently ob"
"serve,” or divine; in II Kings 17:17, it is “enchantments,” as it is also in II"
" Kings 21:6, and II Chron. 33:6, and in Num. 23:23 and 24:1 (as a noun)."

"	Very clearly, occult knowledge is Satanic knowledge. It offers knowledge "
"about the future as a knowledge outside of God and His eternal decree. Thus, ev"
"en when occultism at times gives us valid forecasts concerning the future, as w"
"ith the Witch of Endor (I Sam. 28:7-25), it is false, because it offers that in"
"formation as a forecast in a world stripped of God and His predestination. The "
"same is true today of all who are busy forecasting a variety of predictions con"
"cerning the future of the Soviet Union and the United States. Many of these for"
"ecasters have valid data; some of them, given the many kinds of predictions, wi"
"ll be true as to events. All are false if they see the present and the future a"
"part from God and His predestination. As such, they are dangerous, because they"
" offer a realm of possibility outside of God."
