"ss of a man’s personal commitments he could not disinherit his family by being "
"dispossessed of his land forever.”[i] Over and over again, the Bible declares, "
"“The earth is the Lord’s” (Exod. 9:29; Deut. 10:14; Ps. 24:1; 1 Cor. 10:26, etc"
".), and only God can exact a tax for it. The tithe is God’s tax for the use of "
"the earth; it is not a gift to God but a required tax, and only giving over the"
" ten percent is a gift to God. Such gifts are called “freewill offerings” (Deut"
". 16:10–11; Exod. 36:7; Lev. 22:21, etc.), because they depend on man’s free wi"
