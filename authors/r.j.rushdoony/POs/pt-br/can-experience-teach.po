"se at the present rate, this valley will be completely uninhabited by the next "
"generation.” The city population in that country had grown rapidly; the farm po"
"pulation had declined steadily. Why? The problem was the ancient customs and la"
"ws of inheritance, which were steadily destroying ownership. Some farmers owned"
" only one-eighth or one-sixteenth of their farms. Three married sisters in the "
"valley each owned one-third of their father’s kitchen, although they no longer "
"lived there. Another woman slept in one house, had inherited the right to meals"
" in a second, and the right to warm herself on the bench near the stove in a th"
"ird house. The net result of these laws was that private ownership of land was "
"virtually destroyed; young men were leaving the valley; and it was destined to "
"be uninhabited!"
