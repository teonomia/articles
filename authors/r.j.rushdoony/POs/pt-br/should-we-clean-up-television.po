msgid "One of the things most of us can agree on is that television is full of program"
"ming which is aesthetically and morally on a very low level. The usual targets "
"of the critics of television is the strong emphasis on sex and violence. (One c"
"an add to that the increasing vulgarity of television, so that it is painful to"
" watch even momentarily so cheap and degrading a view of man.)"

" better television if we eliminate the offensive sex and violence, the profanit"

"on without remaking the man means to lay him wide open to seven worse demons (M"
"att. 12:43-45). Such a false reform leads to turning men into "whited sepulcher"

msgid "If all we do is to "clean up" television and the films, will we not be creating"
" whited sepulchers? This is in fact what will result. We will give a facade to "
"humanism to make it resemble Christian morality. Most television programming an"
"d film productions as well give us the "gospel" of humanism. Do we want to put "
"a Christian face on that? Humanism with a facade of Christian morality will be "
"the greatest deception and evil imaginable. Apparently this is what such church"
"men want? What we need instead is programming which reveals a Christian world a"
"nd life view. This means a work of affirmation and reconstruction, an entrance "
"into the arts, not a retreat from them. The image of the Christian as critic is"
" a false one. The true Christian is a builder and a re-creator in Christ our Lo"
"rd; the Christian's calling is to bring every area of life and thought under th"
"e reign of Christ the King."
