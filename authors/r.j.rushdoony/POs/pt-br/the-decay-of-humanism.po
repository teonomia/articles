"	Because more than a few have become aware of the growing decay of our wor"
"ld-wide humanistic culture, the concern for answers is extensive and intense. S"
"ome of the most anti-christian leaders have expressed strongly religious hopes "
"and answers. As Theodore Roszak, in The Making of a Counter Culture (p. 126), s"
"ays of one degenerate writer’s emphasis, “The cry is not for a revolution, but "
"for an apocalypse: a descent of divine fire.” The humanists need miracles and d"
"emand them, they want a radical change in everything except themselves. Even he"
"re, however, some humanists see the problem also. The young leaders of the May,"
" 1968 Paris insurrection, Daniel and Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, in Obsolete Communism"
": The Left-Wing Alternative, write that “The real meaning of revolution is not "
"a change in management, but a change in man.” True enough, but who shall bring "
"about that change in man? God is rejected, so this leaves man in control. Exper"
"iments using man as the test animal are already in progress. Is this what the C"
"ohn-Bendits want? If man is to change man, some kind of coercion and inhumanity"
" becomes inescapable. Man as he is becomes then only a raw material, a resource"
" for the future, and is thus expendable."

"	Such an answer only enforces the call for more statism. Whether proposed "
"by statists or anarchists, the insistence that man must change man is a require"
"ment for statist coercion and control. Having abandoned God, the humanist has n"
"ot thereby rid himself of his need for God. As a result, he makes the state int"
"o his new god. The state is a Moloch demanding the sacrifice of youth in every "
"age, demanding that the priorities of the state become sacrosanct in the eyes o"
"f its citizens. The humanists may rail against the Establishment, but their onl"
"y alternative is to become themselves the Establishment. In the new states of A"
"sia and Africa, revolutions come and go. Each new set of leaders vow idealistic"
"ally to institute a new order and soon reproduce the old evils. Nat Hentoff, wh"
"o earlier wrote an idealizing campaign book about New York’s Mayor John V. Lind"
"say, now finds Lindsay practicing all the tricks of the “power brokers” whom he"
" once fought against. Men have a habit of remaining sinners, and neither state "
"office nor state coercion can usher men into a state of grace. The statist answ"
"er is a moral and social dead end."

"	There are today many earnest champions of reconstruction, concerned human"

"	The financing of godly reconstruction is by means of the tithe (see Repor"

"	During much of the medieval era, health, education and much more were all"
" financed by means of the tithe. Later, under Puritanism, all these things and "
"newer institutions, such as work-houses for job training, were products of the "
"tithe. When state financing returned with the decline of Puritanism, the evange"

"t again of statist answers. W. K. Jordan, Philanthropy in England, 1480-1660, ("
"1959) has given us an account of the English scene in that era. In the U.S., in"
" the first half of the 19th century, voluntary societies, products of tithe fun"

"hools for immigrants, care for orphans, seamen, servants, and others, and to wo"

"	Whatever its faults, America then was a very free society, and its people"
" were truly upper and middle class because of their emphasis on certain princip"
"les. First, they were future oriented as Christians who saw history in terms of"
" God and a glorious and manifest destiny in terms of Him. Second, this purpose "
"was to be unfolded by means of the voluntary principle, and those who believed "
"in that future gave their money and their efforts to furthering it."

"	Social financing cannot be avoided. The state is ready to assume it as a "
"means of power (as is the church); the tithe places the power and decision in t"

"placed. The answer is therefore not legislation but Christian reconstruction. W"
"e cannot wait for people to vote the abolition of welfarism and the public scho"

"	Many of the older agencies, schools, and colleges have been captured by t"

" or the “Establishment” for all its problems. An upper class is too busy with t"

"and we have entered into their labors. Now, in a time of cultural decay, the ne"
"ed to rebuild is especially urgent, and, as always, it takes time, money, and w"
"ork. Those unwilling to pay the price, and those who discourage easily, have no"
