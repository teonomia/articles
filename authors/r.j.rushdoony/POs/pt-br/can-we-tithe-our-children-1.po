"	We and all that we have are God's possession. Children are described as a"
" "gift" or "heritage" from the Lord, and also as a "reward", "boon", or "blessi"
"ng" (Ps. 127:3). To misuse God's gifts and blessings is to incur His wrath. It "
"is only "every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways' who is "ble"
"ssed" (Ps. 128:1)."

"	The first and basic premise of paganism, socialism, and Molech worship is"
" its claim that the state owns the child. The basic premise of the public schoo"

"Isa.29:13). On all such, God's judgment is assured, and God's judgment on our a"
