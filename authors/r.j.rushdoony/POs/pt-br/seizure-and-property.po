msgid "The history of words sometimes tells us much about the history of man. The word"
" “seizure” is a good example. Originally, the word “seizure” was a legal term f"
"or ownership. “Seize” meant legal possession, and “seizing” or “seisin” meant i"
"n early English law possession with quiet enjoyment. In common law “seizen in d"
"eed” means actual possession, and “seizing in law” means the right of present p"
"ossession."

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "Now, of course, “seize” means to confiscate, to take possession by force. The w"
"ord has thus come to mean its exact opposite, changing from the ownership of pr"
"operty to the confiscation by force of something or anything."

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "The history of the change in the meaning of this English word is a complex one,"
" but basically it tells us this: the law, which should have confirmed a man in "
"his “seizing,” began to rob a man of his property. The lords and kings of Engla"
"nd worked too often to dispossess by law a man from his property, and the law o"
"f “seizing” became a law of seizure in the modern sense. The change in the mean"
"ing of the word thus tells us of a change in the life of the kingdom."

msgid "Behind that change was a spiritual change. The Renaissance and its humanism des"
"troyed the old sense of Christian responsibility and law, so that, in terms of "
"Judges 21:25, because Christ was not King in the hearts of men, “every man did "
"that which was right in his own eyes.” The result was a rapid decline of honest"
"y and godliness in every area of life and, lacking moral restraints, men began "
"to exploit one another. Those who had the power to use the courts to do so bega"
"n to confiscate the property of other men, so that the very legal term for owne"
"rship came to mean confiscation."

msgid "We are drifting closer to such a condition daily. To be a property owner is to "
"be the target of confiscatory taxes, crime, and hostility. Men who are professe"
"d “peace lovers” are increasingly also bombers and rioters. Men who claim to be"
"lieve in a religion of love are most likely to spout hatred. Good words are use"
"d as a cover for evil ends, and peace may come to mean war someday, if this tre"
