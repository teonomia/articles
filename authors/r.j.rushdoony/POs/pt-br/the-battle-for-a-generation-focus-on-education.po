"culture to its children. The religious institutions, i.e, church, synagogue, te"

"servatism of religious organizations, the rites and forms remain when the faith"

"	In the United States, the disaster to the wholeness of Biblical faith cam"
"e with the rise in the early 1800s of “heart religion,” with its emphasis on ex"
"perience rather than a commanding world and life faith. According to James Turn"
"er, “heart religion” had four specific elements and/or consequences, all with r"
"oots in the seventeenth century realm of English thought. First, was “the assum"
"ption that knowledge became reliable only when verified in experience.”3 Such a"
" view meant that revelation had to be tested by experience. It also made experi"
"ence the standard in many realms where a very great measure of learning and und"
"erstanding are necessary. Thus, it undermined authority as well as traditional "
"wisdom. The ancient use of proverbs, the crystallization of the wisdom of centu"
"ries, began to wane sharply. The Bible as revelation began to give way to the B"
"ible as a handbook for experiential religion. The faith was thus privatized, an"
"d creeds were shelved."

"	Experience and the here and now took priority over the authority of revel"
"ation. A sound and thorough knowledge of and belief in Scripture was condemned "
"as “head religion,” and “heart religion” was held to be alone acceptable. Such "
"a perspective gives more authority to present feelings than to ages old revelat"
"ion. It became routine to tell people that “head knowledge” and “head faith” we"
"re worthless and that what was necessary for salvation is a particular and dram"
"atic form of “heart experience.” Because of this view, Christian schools in the"

"gion thus became the realm of feeling and pious gush, whereas science became th"
"e sphere of intelligence and knowledge. Instead of theology being the queen of "
"the sciences, it was no longer even a science. Instead of commanding the world "
"and life perspective in every sphere, Christianity became a minor part of the s"
"ocial order, and, instead of shaping the culture, was increasingly shaped by it"
