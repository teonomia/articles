msgid "The Bible is full of economic wisdom which often goes neglected in our day beca"
"use the Bible, the book for all of life, is too commonly reduced to a devotiona"
"l manual and all "non-spiritual" truth is discarded. Solomon, for example, tell"
"s us, "cast thy bread upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after many days" "
"(Eccles. 11:1). The reference here is to rice planting. The rice is broadcast i"
"nto water paddies, as it were; the family's "bread" or food is thrown away, in "
"a sense, but only thereby is a harvest possible in the days to come. In Psalm 1"
"26:5,6, the same fact is stated even more vividly: "They that sow in tears shal"
"l reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall do"
"ubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him." Here we have"
" a famine in view; the precious grain is sown with tears, because life depends "
"upon its harvest. In both texts, the first emphasis is that present advantages "
"must be sacrificed for future benefits; there is no harvest tomorrow without a "
"sowing today. Sowing seed constitutes an investment in the future."

msgid "Second, very obviously, the man who sows seed has, on the most basic and elemen"
"tary level, some hope for the future. A society without hope is present-oriente"
"d. It is a consumer society; it eats up its seed grain rather than planning for"
" a future harvest. It becomes therefore something that God condemns, a debt-ori"
"ented society rather than a saving and sowing one. It pays no heed to the six-y"
"ear limitation on debt, nor to the principal that the godly goal is to owe no m"
"an anything save to love one another (Rom. 13:8). A debt society is death orien"
"ted; it makes saving, thrift, and future-oriented planning difficult or unprofi"
"table, because it encourages consumption but not production. A "tax-break" is o"
"ffered to debtors on their interest payments; savings are taxed (for accrued in"
"terest) as well as production and profit (or harvest). The tax structures of ou"
"r time are anti-Scriptural with a vengeance. Moreover, the moral order is rever"
"sed; debt becomes an asset to these statist humanists, and wealth a liability a"
"nd an evil. Money today does not have gold or silver behind it, but debt. The M"
"onetary Control Act of 1980, which went into effect on June 1, 1981, allows the"
" U.S. to monetize debts other than those of the Federal Government, debts both "
"domestic and foreign. This is eating our bread or grain, not casting it upon th"
"e waters!"

", is everything. This too is the essence o fall the varieties of Keynsian econo"
"mics. Keynes despised the future; his premise was, "In the long run, we are all"

"bt for many, many years to come. They are also in a serious economic "bind." In"
"stead of confessing to the Lord that their debts are violations of His law, and"
" seeking His help to re-order their lives, they pray for "blessings," i.e., to "
"be relieved of their debt situation by some miracle, and without penalties. To "
"be told that they are in sin, and that the wages of sin are always death (Roman"
