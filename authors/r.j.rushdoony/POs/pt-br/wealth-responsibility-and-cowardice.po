"	In recent years, a very important fact with great repercussions in societ"
"y has marked our society. At one time, for better or worse, men of great wealth"
" exercised important powers and positions in society. Their gifts created chari"
"ties, subsidized the arts, and governed many areas of life. In more ways than o"
"ne, men of great wealth set the pace."

"	In this century, this has steadily become reversed. In part, this is due "

"	But this is not all. There are other factors which are far more important"
" which have been at work. There is a very clear religious dimension here which "
"we must never overlook. The Bible is clear that wealth brings with it responsib"
"ilities. Our Lord sums up the meaning of the law and the prophets in these word"
"s: "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to wh"
"om men have committed much, of him they will ask the more" (Luke 12:48). The hi"
"story of Western civilization and Christendom cannot be written apart from thes"
"e words. Both the medieval church, and the Reformation churches, have unleashed"
" vast sums of giving by their insistence on the duties of all who prosper, whet"
"her little or much, towards others. In every part of the world, such Christian "
"giving has made an impact unequalled in all of history. It warps history to mak"
"e no note of this fact."

"	In recent years, however, some signs of change are readily apparent. The "
"patronage of the arts is an obvious realm in which the difference appears. The "
"ultra-modern, avant garde art, really pretentious junk art, has a patronage per"
"haps unequalled in history. To gain respectability, our corporations great and "
"small buy such junk art for their office and corridor walls, and to store in th"
"eir warehouses. The corporations are the mainstay of the various purveyors of j"
"unk art. At the same time, television has on its "public" channels all kinds of"
" programs financed by corporations."

"	Two things can be said. First, all such funding, including much funding o"
"f the Left, wins no friends for the corporations. Their money is taken, and the"
"y continue to be reviled. They in effect finance their own condemnation. Second"
", the corporations are careful to give little or nothing to Christian churches "
"and agencies which are evangelical or reformed. Except for a few men, they act "
"as though some kind of sin against society would be committed by such a gift. S"
"ome executives justify this, saying, our shareholders are not all Christian, so"
" it would mean problems if we gave such gifts. But many of their shareholders a"
"re Christians: does their stand and faith count for nothing? Moreover, how many"
" of their shareholders would favor their gifts to leftist causes?"

"	The problem lies elsewhere. First, too many corporate executives are men "
"without faith. They may belong to "mainline" churches, and, in some parts of th"
"e country,arc expected to join them for public relations purposes, but they are"
" still men without faith, often in churches without faith. Recent studies have "
"shown that, whereas most Americans affirm a Christian faith, a very great major"
"ity of the men in the communications media do not. Moreover, many are strongly "
"anti-Christian. It would be interesting to see if a study of corporate executiv"
"es would give like results. Of course, for public relations purposes, many such"
" executives would perhaps routinely give dishonest answers."

"	Second, without faith, a man finds courage drained out of his system. For"
" him then the world is without meaning, and, in such a world, what is worth fig"
"hting for? To such a man, easy and evasive solutions are the best. Not surprisi"
"ngly, cowardice has become very common among corporate executives. Nowadays, to"

"	As a result, most corporate leaders today are supportive of power, whoeve"
