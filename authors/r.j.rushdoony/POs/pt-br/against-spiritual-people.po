msgid "One of the great heresies of our time is the emphasis on “being spiritual,” as "
"though this means being Christian. Scripture calls us to be filled with the Hol"
"y Ghost, which is something very different. It was a belief of Greek philosophy"
" and religion that man should be spiritual rather than materialistic, and one o"
"f the objections of Greek philosophers to Biblical faith was that it was too ma"

msgid "There is no merit as such in being spiritual. The devil, after all, is entirely"
" spiritual, but this does not make him godly. Over and over again, the command "
"given in Scripture is “Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am "
"the LORD your God” (Lev. 20:7). To be holy, or to be sanctified, and to be spir"
"itual are not necessarily the same. The Scriptures make clear that holiness mea"

"to our marriage vows. We should be honest and avoid all fraudulent business dea"
"lings with our fellow believers and all men. We should not despise other people"
" but be marked rather by brotherly love. Moreover, Paul said, ye should “study "
"to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as w"
"e commanded you.”"
