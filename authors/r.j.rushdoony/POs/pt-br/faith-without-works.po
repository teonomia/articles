msgid "James, the brother of our Lord, tells us very emphatically that “faith without "
"works is dead” (James 2:26). I thought of this recently when I heard an older m"
"an speak of the “old days” when silver dollars were the only kind of money in c"
"irculation in this area, and good men refused to take paper dollars in change. "
"Such paper money was despised as “funny money” and as likely sooner or later to"
" lose value. This attitude was commonplace when I was a boy farmers, ranchers, "
"and miners carried deep leather pouch purses in their jeans to hold “decent” mo"
"ney, silver change and silver dollars."
