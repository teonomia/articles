msgid "Many people like to believe that somewhere invisible rulers pull the strings wh"
"ich govern all of us. Such a belief denies that man is created in the image of "
"God and is governed by two basic motives. First, Paul tells us, all men know th"
"e truth of God, things visible and invisible, because they are written in every"
" atom of our being by our Creator. Men "hold" or suppress these things because "
"of their unrighteousness or injustice. No man anywhere can escape this knowledg"
"e (Romans 1:17-21). For this reason all men are "without excuse." Second, all m"
"en everywhere, as sons and daughters of Adam, are fallen, and they seek to be t"
"heir own gods, determining law, morality, and all good and evil for themselves "
"(Gen. 3:5). The strings that pull us come out of our heart and mind."
