msgid "Faithfulness is a virtue stressed throughout the law and in all the Scriptures "
"as a religious and moral necessity. The requirement of faithfulness to God, to "
"law, to marriage, to every godly obligation is emphatically stressed. Moses sum"
"moned Israel to observe God’s law-word without turning “to the right hand or to"
" the left,” and if they did walk in obedience, it would be well with them, and "
"their days would be prolonged (Dt. 5:32, 32). Believers are called “the faithfu"
"l” in the church’s terminology, and the term “faithful” is in Scripture the hig"
"hest praise (Prov. 20:6; Rev. 17:14; Mt. 25:21; etc.). The walk of the faithful"
" is in “the paths of righteousness” (Ps. 23:3); paths means ruts, wheel-tracks,"
" and the reference is to established habits of godliness. God establishes His f"
"aithful ones in the engrained ruts or habits of righteousness."

msgid "Sanity, character, and stability rest on faithfulness, on dependability. Irresp"
"onsibility is the consequence of faithlessness, and ultimately, insanity so-cal"
"led, which is the rejection of responsibility; it is the unwillingness to be fa"
"ithful, to establish the habits of righteousness. Not surprisingly, modern phil"
"osophy, which has proclaimed so emphatically man’s freedom from law and from Go"
"d, has been frequently marked by the fact of mad or at best unstable men in its"
" ranks."

msgid "The non-Christian mentality is commonly characterized by this war on faithfulne"
"ss. A study of Indian sculpture speaks of “the cult of desire” as the “road to "
"release” from the burden of life.[1] In this cult, “the other world and this we"
"re made one,” and “Life and Liberation ceased to be separate entities.”[2] Salv"
"ation meant the total acceptance of all of life as holy: “the holiness of desir"
"e would … sanctify any vehicle: and if the mind is pure, all else, whether woma"
"n or man or animal, is but means.”[3] This means that the individual should “in"
"dulge in desire irrespective of the mate, divine, human or bestial.”[4]"

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "To accept every act as holy is to deny emphatically the principle of discrimina"
"tion in terms of good and evil. Faithfulness is adherence to an absolute law, a"
"nd to persons and causes in terms of that absolute law and the sovereign God of"
" that law. As against faithfulness, the way or walk is made a systematic unfait"
"hfulness as man’s life, joy, and pleasure. Thus, in Africa, the Nandi have a sa"
"ying, “A new vagina is comforting.”[5]"

msgid "Because there is no principle of discrimination between good and evil, man and "
"animals, persons do not count. Danielsson’s account of Polynesian love holds th"
"at, because of the lack of standards and of discriminations, “There was therefo"
"re no reason to prefer any particular woman or man.”[6] His description is, of "
"course, of a degenerated culture, as is that of Suggs, whose description is of "
"depersonalized and degenerate sexuality.[7]"

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "The need for unfaithfulness as a principle came to focus in an organized moveme"
"nt, romanticism. Scott’s description of “the romantic fallacy” is excellent: “i"
"t identifies beauty with strangeness.”[8] The logic of this position is that, t"
"he stranger the object, person, or act, the better it is to the romantic. In Ne"
"wton’s words, “The romantic … can never rejoice in the normal. What interests h"
"im must be the exceptional.”[9] This means interest in “mystery, abnormality, a"
"nd conflict,”[10] a dislike of “whatever is law-abiding, whatever conforms to a"
" pattern.” The romantic “refuses to acknowledge the existence of law as applied"
" to self-expression … ‘Thou shalt be exceptional and follow that which is excep"
"tional’ is his only commandment.… Abnormality is the negative of law. Its very "
"existence depends on its refusal to conform to law-abiding behaviour.”[11] This"
" means that freedom is identified with evil, sexual expression with unfaithfuln"
"ess and perversion, artistic ability with violations of standards and perversit"
"y, and character with instability. The growth of perversion and perversity in e"
"very area of life is proportionate to the decline of faith and faithfulness."

msgid "Not only has there been a greater prevalence of perversity and perversion, but "
"also a developing pride and boastfulness therein, as though these acts represen"
"t the wave of the future.[12] Health, vitality, and character are associated by"
" these “new” people with sexual license, and faithfulness with Puritanism and c"
"rime.[13] In reality, the character of those given to this so-called sexual fre"
"edom is one of tormented conflicts and childish tantrums.[14]"
