msgid "The original constitutional settlement did not propose a "separation of Church "
"and State," although that phrase is increasingly used by the courts to sum up t"
"he constitutional position. Because all the states had their own religious sett"
"lements or establishments, the First Amendment simply barred Congress or the Fe"
"deral Government from entering into an area where jurisdiction was reserved to "
"the states. The states had the right to make such establishments or settlements"
" as they or their subordinate bodies, the counties and cities, chose to make. O"
"nly after the Fourteenth Amendment was interpreted by the Supreme Court to appl"
"y to all states was there a denial of the power of the states to make such esta"
"blishments. To return to the so-called problem of "Church and State," there is "
"no possibility of any resolution of the basic issue until the question is prope"
"rly formulated. To speak of a church and state problem is to foreclose any solu"
"tion."

msgid "What then is the basic problem? Not only is every church a religious institutio"
"n, but every state or social order is a religious establishment. Every state is"
" a law order, and every law order represents an enacted morality, with procedur"
"es for the enforcement of that morality. Every morality represents a form of th"
"eological order, i.e., is an aspect and expression of a religion. The church th"
"us is not the only religious institution; the state also is a religious institu"
"tion. More often than the church, the state has been the central religious inst"
"itution of most civilizations through the centuries. The war between the Roman "
"Empire and the early church was a religious warfare, a struggle between two cla"
"imants who represented rival religions and wanted to order society in terms of "
"their faith. The claims of each faith were total claims, as all religious claim"
"s are. Thus, American Puritans held that the Bible is "the revealed truth and t"
"he source of all reason and morality." Similarly, humanists today believe that "
"the affirmation of the autonomy of man and his mind constitutes the source of a"
"ll true reason and morality."

msgid "To return to the basic problem today, the real issue is not between church and "
"state, but is simply this: the state as a religious establishment has progressi"
"vely disestablished Christianity as its law foundation, and, while professing n"
"eutrality, has in fact established humanism as the religion of the state. When "
"the religion of a people changes, its laws inevitably reflect that change and c"
"onform themselves to the new faith and the new morality. There has been decepti"
"on on the part of the courts, by their profession of religious neutrality, as t"
"hey have substituted one religion for another, humanism for Christianity. The b"
"asic reason, however, has been the theological collapse of the churches, and th"
"is has been true of all of them. In the dominant evangelical circles, this coll"
"apse came first. Hudson has referred to this as "the deeper malady,...the theol"
"ogical erosion which had taken place during the nineteenth century." In evangel"
"icalism, "Doctrinal definitions tended to be neglected in the stress that was p"
"laced upon ‘heart religion' and the ‘conversion experience'." This theological "
"collapse led to the untenable belief in religious neutralism and to the surrend"
"er of Christian schools for statist education. As a result, humanism became the"
" established religion of state and school, and, by infiltration, of the churche"
"s as well."

" churches, and most of society. Christianity is quite logically progressively e"
"xcluded from state, school and church and has a weak and scarcely tenable posit"

msgid "At times in the past, the conflict between church and state has been an institu"
"tional conflict, sometimes for power, and often for very principled reasons of "
"jurisdiction. It is more than a jurisdictional dispute now: it is religious con"

"n this struggle, however, the state has taken on a power far greater than itsel"

":4). He shall break His enemies with a rod of iron."
