"	J.S. Mackenzie, in his Manual of Ethics (London, 1900), declared, "To be "
"free means that one is determined by nothing but oneself." Such a freedom, howe"
"ver, can only be ascribed to God. Mackenzie in effect posited a necessary aseit"
"y for man, so that man could be freed from all determination external to himsel"
"f."

"	From ancient times to the present, such a view of man has been repeatedly"
" popular, although arising in different contents and cultural traditions. It ha"
"s had competition, however, from another tradition. Just as Mackenzie represent"
"s one extreme, so too does Karma represent another. For the doctrine of Karma, "
"all acts have a necessary and inescapable link to the past and to the future. T"
"here is an inexorable chain of causes and effects, so that, instead of man bein"
"g one who is determined by nothing but himself, as with Mackenzie, man becomes "
"nothing but a brief and fleeting focus of consequences. We may call him a perso"
"n, but he is really only a moment in a chain of causality, a step, not a determ"
"iner."

"	In a sense, these two doctrines represent an antithesis. However, to hold"
" so is to overlook a central fact: both absolve man of responsibility. If man i"
"s determined by nothing but himself, he is responsible to no one; he therefore "
"cannot be judged by an external law or standard. He is then his own god and law"
". He is his own universe and causality, and none can judge him. However, if man"
" is simply a link in the chain of Karma, then he again is beyond criticism beca"
"use he is beyond responsibility. As a product of Karma, he is no more than a co"
"nsequence of a multiplicity of causes, and he bears a burden not of his making."
" He is a victim, and hence not responsible. Both positions thus mark man as a c"
"ovenant-breaker who refuses to acknowledge his sin before God."

"	In both positions, moreover, a fundamental principle of polytheism appear"

"n the doctrine of Karma, the multiple and accruing causes become the many gods."
" In either case, man denies responsibility."

"	The doctrine of creation, however, sets forth, among other things, two fa"
"cts which make man fully responsible. First, man is God's creation. The univers"
"e and man move, not in terms of an abstract, impersonal, and inexorable causali"
"ty, but in terms of God and His law. The common doctrine of causality, because "
"of its Greek origins, depersonalizes causality, which is seen as a part of the "
"blind world of matter. This doctrine of causality has great affinity to Karma, "
"and, like it, presupposes some kind of ultimate other than the sovereign and ab"
"solutely personal God of Scripture. A depersonalized causality is nonsense: it "
"is a myth and a delusion. Second, man is created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26"
"-28), so that, by virtue of that image, he is a responsible creature who has a "
"secondary power of determination. He is not a god, but neither is he a passing "
"link in a chain of consequences. He is man, a responsible creature, and hence, "
"in his fall, under God's moral judgement (Gen. 3:16-19; Rom. 3:10-19). His crea"
"tureliness is an inescapable fact, as well as his creation in God's image. Simi"
"larly, the doctrine of providence has major implications with respect to man's "
"responsibility. The Stoics used the word providence as a synonym for nature, ne"
"cessity, and fate; it was non-personal and no more than a causal nexus. Thus, d"
"espite the use of the term providence, the Stoic doctrine was closer by far to "
"Karma than to Scripture."

"	The Biblical doctrine of providence gives us the personal and triune God "
"whose government totally comprehends all things. This means, first, that becaus"
"e it is a universe of personal facts that surround us, and the personal God, ou"
"r response and actions cannot be impersonal: they are always personal and moral"
". Neither we nor creation are abstractions, nor is the movement and nature of t"
"hings a product of blind necessity. We live, move, and have our being in God an"
"d His universe, in a moral context at all times (Acts 17:28) so that we can nev"
"er escape moral decisions nor moral responsibility. Man was no sooner created t"
"han he was confronted by the necessity for moral decisions (Gen. 2:16-17). The "
"moral choice placed before Adam was not something imposed by God on Adam but an"
" inescapable fact of creation and providence. Since God has created man and all"
" things else, and God's absolute and total government rules providentially in a"
"nd through all things, moral responsibility is an inescapable part of the const"
"itution of things. There is no neutral, non-moral corner in all of creation. Go"
"d's total providence is His absolute wisdom, holiness, and righteousness in act"
"ion. Man's life is thus not in a vacuum but in a moral context and continuum. N"
"ot even death provides the sinner an escape from this moral universe."

"tonists in the church. In Deuteronomy 23:12-14 we have a law wherein God requir"
"es even an army on the march to practice sanitation where defecation is concern"
"ed. The neoplatonist is not averse to state laws on sanitation, but he wants Go"
"d to remain "spiritual" and above and beyond such matters. He thus turns over a"
