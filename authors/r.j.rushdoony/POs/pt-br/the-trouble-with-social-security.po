"ocial security between the ages of 18 and 65, the likelihood of getting his mon"
"ey back is poor. His life expectancy after 65 makes it unlikely that he will ge"
"t back all or half the amount he paid in for 47 years. If he dies, his widow's "
"benefits again are too small to add up to any significant return on his "invest"
"ment." The combined amount paid in by the employer and employee adds up to a ve"
"ry considerable sum, and the returns on it are small. The only real gainer from"
" social security is the federal government, In 1969, Edward J. Van Allen, in Th"
"e Trouble With Social Security, pointed out that a young worker who began payin"
"g into social security at age 18 and retired at 65 would have to live to be 111"
" years old to break even. If any insurance company or pension plan gave as poor"
" returns, or misused funds as does Social Security, the managers thereof would "
"quickly find themselves in prison!"

msgid "The social security system, according to the federal courts, is not an insuranc"
"e or pension plan but a tax. It gives us no claims nor rights; Congress can alt"
"er the benefits at will, or cut us out of them, and, for some, this has happene"
"d. Moreover, because the federal government uses the funds as they come in, ins"
"tead of saving them, we must pay interest (in the form of extra taxes) on the f"
"ederal bonds which have replaced our payments. Moreover, the social security sy"
"stem promotes insecurity. It limits our ability to save; it prevents us from in"
"vesting in sound pension plans, and it fuels inflation. If, instead of a federa"
"lly operated system, the law required free-market insurance and pension plans t"
"o provide the benefits, we would then have a sound and stable system."

msgid "There is, however, another aspect to social security, the moral and religious f"
"actor. A simple historical fact tells us much at this point. Some years after t"
"he War of Independence, the U.S. Congress passed a pension plan for all veteran"
"s of that war. All veterans desiring a pension were to apply at designated plac"
"es, submit evidence of their military status, and dictate to a court clerk thei"
"r memories of the war. Those brief memoirs give us sometimes vivid glimpses of "
"George Washington, Putnam, and other leaders of that era. The stories, however,"
" come as a shock to any Christian reader. Were there no Christians in the Conti"
"nental Army? Almost uniformly, the veterans showed no interest in the faith or "
"the church in their mature years."

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "The answer to that question is a very simple one. No Christian veteran applied "
"for a federal pension, and the churches were united in their opposition to any "
"such application. They believed that Christian participation in a state or fede"
"ral pension plan was morally wrong. They based their stand on many texts in Scr"
"ipture, from the Old Testament and the New, and they saw their position as summ"
"ed up and required by I Timothy 5:8, "But if any provide not for his own, and s"
"pecially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith and is worse than"
" an infidel." From the days of the early church until this century, and definit"
"ely through the first half of the last, Christians saw this as a binding duty a"
"nd law. For them it meant, first, that every Christian has a duty before God to"
" care for his own family, especially those in his own household or under his ro"
"of. This did not apply to those who, like the Prodigal Son, had denied the fait"
"h and separated themselves. The family is more than a blood institution in Scri"
"pture: it is a faith bond. Indeed, where a son is an incorrigible and habitual "
"delinquent, the family must witness for the faith and against the son by denoun"
"cing him to the authorities (Deut. 2l:18-21). On the other hand, all believing "
"members must be cared for. Our Lord denounces all who refused to provide for th"
"eir parents and felt that the money for parental support could be better used b"
"y the Temple, or God's ministry. He equates this with cursing one's parents, wh"
"ich the law says requires the death penalty (Mark 7:9-13). Very clearly, failur"
"e to provide for one's needy kin is a fearful offense in the sight of God. The "
"social security system is a welcome fact for all such sinners, who are readier "
"to see this tax increase than to care for their parents."

msgid "Second, the "family" of which Paul speaks in I Timothy 5:8 includes our fellow "
"believers. Very early, following Old Testament practices, the disciples took st"
"eps to provide for the needy widows and other like persons in the church. In Ac"
"ts 6:1-3, we do not have the institution of such a practice; it was already a ""
"daily ministration." Rather, what we have is the organization of a diaconate to"
" provide an efficient and well organized ministry in this area. The work of the"
" early church in this area was remarkable. No charity beyond one day was given "
"to able-bodied men, but work was found for them, or work was made for them on s"
"ubsistence wages. Indeed, one of the telling "advertisements" for the early chu"
"rch throughout the Roman Empire was their care one for another. Hence the sayin"
"g, "Behold, how these Christians love one another!" To be a Christian meant to "
"be a responsible person and a member of a larger family. This is one aspect of "
"what Paul means when he says, "we are members one of another" (Eph. 4:25). It w"
"as not a light thing to be a Christian: it meant joining, or rather, being adop"
"ted into, the family of Jesus Christ as a working, obedient, and responsible me"
"mber."
