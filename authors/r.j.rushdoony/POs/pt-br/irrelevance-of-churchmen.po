msgid "It was around 1660 that the structure of Western civilization began its shift f"
"rom a Christian to a humanistic basis. In England, this meant the accession of "
"Charles II; in France, Louis XIV was soon to begin changing the country; German"
"y, recuperating from the Thirty Years' War, was no longer determined by religio"
"n but by the balance of power. Spain was lacking in the religious fervor of Phi"
"lip II of some years previously, and Russia was beginning its westernization in"
" terms of humanism."

msgid "Earlier, the goal of all Christians had been godly rule in every area of life: "
"in the individual by means of regeneration and sanctification, in the state by "
"means of obedience to God's law in education by the government of all disciplin"
"es in terms of Christian premises, and in every area of life by the Scriptures."
" But, as Lamont pointed out, "By 1660 these assumptions are no longer widely te"
"nable...Virtue was now an end in itself, not a means to an end?" (i.e., the wor"
"ld under God's law), and the province of religion was reduced to the inner life"
" alone. (William M. Lamont: Godly Rule, Politics and Religion, 1603-60. pp. 163"
", 166. London: Macmillan, 1969.) The older dream persisted longer in America an"
"d was revived by some theologians after 1740, but in the mid-1800s, it too had "
"faded."

"ad declared the requirements of the word of God for every area of life. It had "
"required the state to be specifically Christian, the schools to educate in term"
"s of the word of God, callings and vocations to be governed by Biblical premise"
"s, and every area of life to be under the dominion of God. The requirement to b"
"e Christian was not limited to the church: it was mandatory for the whole world"
" and for every aspect and sphere thereof. After 1660, and especially with the r"
"ise of pietism, the role of the church (and the Christian) was limited to piety"
" and worship. Previously, this limited concern had been the characteristic of m"
"ystics and some (but by no means all) cloistered persons, monks and nuns. Now, "
"the entire church began to remake itself into a cloister. "Every man a priest" "
"had become "every man a monk.""

msgid "As the church began its slow retreat from the world, the humanists began their "
"conquest of it. The state was first of all captured, and, especially after the "
"French Revolution, became more and more openly humanistic in one country after "
"another. Schools were also captured, turned into state institutions, and made t"
"he voices of the new established religion, humanism. Law was steadily changed f"
"rom a Biblical to a humanistic basis and one area after another captured for th"
"e new religion. This conquest was capped by the possession of the churches by t"
"he new religion. Priest and pastor began to proclaim, not the word of God, but "
"the word of man, not regeneration by the sovereign and saving grace of God, but"
" revolution by the supposedly sovereign power of man. Not the Kingdom of God bu"
"t the Kingdom of Man was the gospel of the new order in the churches. The new p"
"ilgrimage of man was not to Bethlehem or Golgotha, but to Dracula's Castle (see"

msgid "This was not the first time humanism had captured the church, nor the first tim"
"e the church had been irrelevant to its purpose and hostile to it. Barraclough "
"has written, of the Renaissance popes, that "the popes of the first half of the"
" fifteenth century, from Martin V to Nicholas V, gave way again both to fiscali"
"sm on a scale unthought of earlier (for example, the wholesale creation of new "
"offices for the sole purpose of selling them), and to nepotism so unashamed (fo"
"r example, the placing of the pope's illegitimate offspring in the college of C"
"ardinals) that it might be thought that Christendom would have revolted in scan"
"dal. What is astounding is that it did not: and the fact that it did not is the"
" best evidence that people had, so to say, already ‘written off' the papacy; it"
" no longer had any hold over men's minds - not even enough to provoke angry hos"
"tility." (Geoffrey Barraclough: The Medieval Papacy, p. 192. Harcourt, Brace, &"
"amp; World, 1968.) Once again, the church does not matter much, because it has "
"ceased to be relevant: its gospel is the state. It has confused godly rule with"
" statist rule, and its answer to most problems is the capture and control of th"
"e state."
