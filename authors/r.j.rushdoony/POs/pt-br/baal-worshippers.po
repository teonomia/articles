msgid "In the week of August 26 through 31, 1974, as the California State Senate rushe"
"d to conclude its work, 496 bills were quickly passed with no discussion on the"
" floor. These were approved, without debate, in blocks of twenty to sixty bills"
". These measures were appropriations and regulatory measures. Every Californian"
" is a little poorer and more regulated because of them."

msgid "What happened was not unusual either for California or for other states. About "
"one-fourth of all bills are passed without debate in California, and in some st"
"ates the ratio is higher. There is discussion and debate, of course, in committ"
"ee hearings."

msgid "Why do such things happen? The primary fault is not in the senators but in the "

"gard the passage of a bill governing others, or spending money for some cause, "
"as the salvation of man. They are like the prophets of Baal who cried, “O Baal,"
" hear us” (1 Kings 18:26). They come to wake up their Baal, the state, and ther"

"sult, each year we will be a little less free, and a little more taxed, and so "
"it will continue as long as we continue to be Baal-worshippers."
