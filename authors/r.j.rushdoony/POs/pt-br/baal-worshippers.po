msgid "In the week of August 26 through 31, 1974, as the California State Senate rushe"
"d to conclude its work, 496 bills were quickly passed with no discussion on the"
" floor. These were approved, without debate, in blocks of twenty to sixty bills"
". These measures were appropriations and regulatory measures. Every Californian"
" is a little poorer and more regulated because of them."

"one-fourth of all bills are passed without debate in California, and in some st"

"as the salvation of man. They are like the prophets of Baal who cried, “O Baal,"
" hear us” (1 Kings 18:26). They come to wake up their Baal, the state, and ther"
