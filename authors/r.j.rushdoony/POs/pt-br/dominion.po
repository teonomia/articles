", no longer an exercise of power under God and to His glory, but a desire to be"

"own god, deciding for himself what constitutes right and wrong (Gen. 3:5). The "
"ultimacy of man in both law and power was asserted."

msgid "History therefore has seen the long and bitter consequence of man's perverted u"
"rge to dominion. Man has made vicious and perverted use of man individually, in"
" gang activities, and as an army or a nation. History is a long tale of horror "
"in which man has sought power and dominion as an end in itself. George Orwell i"
"n 1984 saw the meaning of this fallen urge to dominion: "If you want a picture "
"of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face-forever." This sinful, f"
"allen urge to dominion is prominent in every sphere of modern life, as well as "
"in all history. It certainly governs the political world, where the state daily"
" gains power for power's sake."

msgid "The word meek is a Biblical term. It is used in Numbers 12:3 to describe Moses,"
" who is termed "very meek"; Moses hardly jibes with modern ideas of meekness. I"
"n fact, Moses is described as meek "above all the men which were upon the face "
"of the earth." Marsh indicates the meaning of meek: "Moses does not fight for h"
"is own status before men, but is concerned to be Yahweh's servant. Therefore Ya"
"hweh cares for him and his position among the people."1 The word meek thus refe"
"rs primarily to a spiritual state in relationship to God. Elliott noted, "It ma"
"y be observed, further, that the word anav, meek, is frequently interchanged wi"
"th the cognate word ani, and that the meaning may be bowed down, or oppressed.""
"2 The meaning is further clarified by the Beatitude: "Blessed are the meek: for"
" they shall inherit the earth" (Matt. 5:5). Dominion over the earth is given to"
" the meek, and meekness clearly has reference to God. The meek are the redeemed"
" whom God has burdened, oppressed, and broken to harness, so that they are tame"
"d and workable. God subjected Moses to a more rigorous discipline than any othe"
"r believer of his day, and Moses accepted that oppression, grew in terms of it,"
" and became disciplined and strong. Hence, Moses was the meekest man of his age"
". Meekness is thus not mousiness, but disciplined strength in and under God."

"d Sadducees, Christ's conduct was firm and resolute. As Christ used the term me"
"ekness, it meant, not the surrender of dominion, but rather the wise, merciful,"
" and gracious use of dominion. We cannot understand the meaning of meekness in "
"Scripture unless we realize that it is not the surrender of dominion but rather"
" the humble and godly use of dominion that it has reference to. The blessed mee"
"k are the tamed of God, those harnessed to His law-word and calling, who shall "

"glect the total witness of Scripture to private property. The so-called communi"
"sm of Acts 2:41-47, also cited by ecclesiastical socialists, was simply a volun"
"tary sharing on the part of some (Acts 5). It was limited to Jerusalem. Because"
" the believers took literally the words of Christ concerning the fall of Jerusa"
"lem (Matt. 24:1-28), they liquidated their properties there. The wealthier memb"
"ers placed some or all of these funds at the church's disposal, so that a witne"

msgid "The earth is indeed the Lord's, as is all dominion, but God has chosen to give "
"dominion over the earth to man, subject to His law-word, and property is a cent"
"ral aspect of that dominion. The absolute and transcendental title to property "
"is the Lord's; the present and historical title to property is man's. The owner"
"ship of property does not leave this world when it is denied to man; it is simp"
"ly transferred to the state. If the contention of the liberals that the earth i"
"s the Lord's, not man's, is to be applied as they require it, then it must be a"
"pplied equally to the state; the state then must be denied all right to own or "
"control property. The Scripture, however, places property in the hands of the f"
"amily, not the state. It gives property to man as an aspect of his dominion, as"
