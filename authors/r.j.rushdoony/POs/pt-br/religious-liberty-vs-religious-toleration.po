msgid "Religious Liberty vs Religious TolerationBy R. J. RushdoonyNovember 03, 2013"

msgid "One of the areas of profound ignorance today is religious liberty and the meani"
"ng thereof. The common pattern throughout history, including in the Roman Empir"
"e, has been religious toleration, a very different thing."
msgstr ""

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "In religious toleration, the state is paramount, and, in every sphere, its powe"
"rs are totalitarian. The state is the sovereign or lord, the supreme religious "
"entity and power. The state decrees what and who can exist, and it establishes "
"the terms of existence. The state reserves the power to license and tolerate on"
"e or more religions upon its own conditions and subject to state controls, regu"
"lation, and supervision."
msgstr ""

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "The Roman Empire believed in religious toleration. It regarded religion as good"
" for public morale and morals, and it therefore had a system of licensure and r"
"egulation. New religions were ordered to appear before a magistrate, affirm the"
" lordship or sovereignty of Caesar, and walk away with a license to post in the"
"ir meeting-place."
msgstr ""

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "The early church refused licensure, because it meant the lordship of Caesar ove"
"r Christ and His church. The early church refused toleration, because it denied"
" the right of the state to say whether or not Christ's church could exist, or t"
"o set the conditions of its existence. The early church rejected religious tole"
"ration for religious liberty."

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "Over the centuries, both Catholics and then Protestants often fought for religi"
"ous liberty. Over the centuries also, the churches too often capitulated to rel"
"igious toleration, with very evil results. Toleration was productive of fearful"
" evils. First, one church was tolerated and established by the state, not by Ch"
"rist, as the "privileged" or state-tolerated institution. This "privilege" call"
"ed for concessions to the state."
msgstr ""

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "These took a variety of forms. It could mean that the state appointed or contro"
"lled the bishops (Protestant or Catholic). It meant that only the state could g"
"ive permission for a meeting of the church's national convocation or general as"
"sembly. In a variety of ways, establishment meant an establishment under the st"
"ate's control. At its best, the church was turned into a privileged house-slave"
"; at its worst, the church was simply a part of the bureaucracy, and the workin"
"g pastors were rare and alone. Sooner or later, an establishment meant subservi"
"ence and bondage to the state."

msgid "Second, the tolerated church became a parasite, because it was dependent too of"
"ten on state aid to collect its tithes and dues. It lived, not because of the f"
"aith of the people, but because of the state's subsidy. As a result, the state "
"church served the state, not the Lord, nor the Lord's people. (When the states "
"turned humanistic and, losing interest in their captive churches, began to cut "
"their "privileges" and subsidies, revivals broke out in many established church"
"es as a result!)"
msgstr ""

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "Third, the tolerated or established church became a persecuting church. It coul"
"d not compete with its now illegal rivals in faith, and so it used the state to"
" persecute its competitors. Both catholic and Protestant establishments built u"
"p an ugly record in this respect. Meanwhile, their humanist foes could criticiz"
"e their intolerance and speak of this inhumanity as a necessary aspect of chris"
"tianity!"

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "Fourth, religious toleration leads to intolerance, as it should now be apparent"
". Toleration is licensure; it is a state subsidy, and those possessing it want "
"a monopoly. Hence, intoleration of competitors results, and the church becomes "
"blind to all issues save monopoly. In 17th century England, for example, the bl"
"indness of the Church of England under Archbishop Laud, as he fought the Purita"
"ns, was staggering. However, when Cromwell came to power, the Presbyterians bec"
"ame a one-issue party, the issue being the control and possession of the Church"
" of England. Had they triumphed, the evils of Laud would have been reproduced. "
"Cromwell balked them; later, the Presbyterians undermined the Commonwealth and "
"helped bring in the depraved Charles II, who quickly ejected them from the Chur"
"ch of England. In Colonial America, uneasy semi-establishments existed. Technic"
"ally, the Church of England was the established church for all the crown realms"
", including Catholic lreland. (Ireland was never more Catholic than after Engla"
"nd imposed an alien church on the land!) Carl Bridenbaugh, in Mitre and Sceptre"
" (1962), showed how the fear and threat of a full-scale establishment with Amer"
"ican bishops alarmed Americans and led to the War of Independence. Meanwhile, i"
"n the colonies, men began to oppose religious toleration in favor of religious "
"liberty. Here, the Baptists were most important, especially Isaac Backus."

msgid "Backus declared, "We view it to be our incumbent duty to render unto Caesar the"
" things that are his but also that it is of as much importance not to render un"
"to him anything that belongs only to God, who is to be obeyed rather than any m"
"an. And as it is evident that God always claimed it as his sole prerogative to "
"determine by his own laws what his worship shall be, who shall minister in it, "
"and how they shall be supported, so it is evident that this prerogative has bee"
"n, and still is, encroached upon in our land." (Wm. J. Mcloughlin, editor: Isaa"
"c Backus on Church, State, and Calvinism, Pamphlets, 1754-1789, p. 317. Harvard"
" University Press, 1965.) The defenders of establishment or toleration became, "
"Backus said, "Caesar's friend," citing the Pharisees who said to Rome's magistr"
"ates about Jesus, "If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend" (John"
" 19:12). We cannot make the state the definer of man's duty to God, as the esta"
"blishment-toleration position does. This position, Backus held, takes matters o"
"f faith from the conscience of man to the councils of state and thus undermines"
" true faith. Backus saw that the new country would have no unity if establishme"
"nt and toleration became lawful in the Federal Union. Backus quoted Cotton Math"
"er, who said, "Violences may bring the erroneous to be hypocrites, but they wil"
"l never bring them to be believers." The heart of Backus' position was this: "R"
"eligion (meaning Biblical religion) was prior to all states and kingdoms in the"
" world and therefore could not in its nature be subject to human laws" (p. 432)"

"control and destroy. Now, these humanistic statists tell us it is a subsidy! Ta"
"x exemption is called "Federal financial assistance," and the courts hold that "

" Meese and 8 or 10 Justice Department lawyers in the White House, Meese (a Luth"

"orbidden to discriminate with respect to creed! This would mean equal time for "
