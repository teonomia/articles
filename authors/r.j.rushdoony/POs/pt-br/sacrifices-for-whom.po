msgid "We hear a great deal nowadays about the necessity for sacrifices, and it all so"
"unds noble and good, but the more basic question needs to be asked: sacrifices "
"to and for whom? Generalizations sound good but can be dangerous. Love is fine,"
" and wives should be loved, but the love of evil is wrong, and if it is your ne"
"ighbor’s wife you are loving, you are in trouble with God and man."

msgid "David taught us something about sacrifices. He and his men were in a stronghold"
", and the Philistines had captured his hometown, Bethlehem. The water in their "
"fortress was poor drinking, and David, on drinking it one day, longed for the g"
"ood waters of home, saying, “Oh that one would give me drink of the water of th"
"e well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” Three of David’s loyal soldiers bro"
"ke through the enemy lines, crept into Bethlehem and drew a canteen of water fr"
"om the well. The next day they gave it proudly to David, who was deeply moved. "
"“Nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the Lord. And "
"he said, be it far from me, O Lord, that I should do this: is not this the bloo"
"d of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? Therefore he would not drink"
" it” (2 Sam. 23:14–17). In other words, while David was greatly moved by the de"
"votion of his men, he felt that only God could be the object of such a sacrific"
"e and risk, and he poured out the water as a religious offering to God."

msgid "This fine sense of proportion and faith is lacking in our modern talk about sac"
"rifice. Does any politician have a right to ask sacrifices of us which only God"
" can ask? When necessary for the defense of our country, God’s law does call fo"
"r military duty and protection, but the extent to which the civil government ca"
"n ask us to sacrifice ourselves does not go beyond that. Too many politicians a"
"re asking more of us than God asks."

msgid "What a man sacrifices for above all else, that is his true object of worship an"
"d his god. Whenever a politician, reformer, business executive, husband, wife, "
"or anyone else demands sacrifices of us above and beyond the due service God re"
"quires of us, he is playing god. The idea that we are not really living right u"
"nless we are miserable and are sacrificing ourselves for and to everyone under "
"the sun is ridiculous and anti-Christian. While ungodly prosperity is condemned"
", godly prosperity is given as the worthy object of prayer by the Bible: “Save "
"now, I beseech thee, O Lord: O Lord I beseech thee, send now prosperity” (Ps. 1"
"18:25). The Bible says to the believer that “the whole duty of man” is to “Fear"
" God, and keep his commandments” (Ecc. 12:13). Thus, when anyone asks sacrifice"
"s of us which only God can rightly ask, we can with justice and true holiness r"
"espond: we will do our duty under God, but more than that, you cannot ask. The "
"Lord alone is our God, and we offer sacrifices to none other."
