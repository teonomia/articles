"provide cradle to grave security, as well as "social justice." We need to remem"
"ber that other agencies have at times assumed this role. In old China, the effe"
"ctive government was not the emperor but the family system. It provided the bas"

"sly believed to be justice, and the family also provided social security. All t"
"his was accompanied by religious ideas and practices alien to Biblical faith, b"
"ut old China was ruled by the family system more effectively than by civil auth"

"ty had already acquired the general outlines of a little sovereign State."1 The"
" monastery, usually begun on donated land, was a landed estate. The lands were "
"often marginal and undeveloped; through good administration, they became richer"
" than surrounding properties. The monastery would commonly have one or two hund"
"red monks. It also acquired serfs, who "were part of the monastic ‘family' and "
"often better off there than in lay service."2 Independent small landowners woul"
"d frequently seek monastic protection and oversight, as would villages. The mon"
"astery lent money to these peoples at a lesser rate of interest than profession"
"al moneylenders. Surplus production was sold by the monastery at lower prices t"
"han those charged by others. All charity was in the hands of the church, and th"
"e monasteries took over a large part of it. Travellers and pilgrims were housed"
"; infirmaries cared for the sick, and learning in varying degrees was preserved"
