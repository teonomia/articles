msgid "Words change their meanings, and people who assume that older meanings still pr"
"evail invite deception thereby. It is part of current Marxist ideology to give "
"a new content and an alien meaning to such familiar words as peace, freedom, re"
"public, law, and so on."

msgid "New meanings precede revolutions, because the content of human hopes is altered"
" dramatically, and the existing order finds that it cannot satisfy the new mean"
"ings. Before the French Revolution, the idea of liberty had taken on a new mean"
"ing, a very different one than had previously prevailed. As Frank E. Manuel, in"
" The Prophets of Paris (1962), pointed out, "The very term liberty lost its med"
"ieval connotation of a privilege and became the right to bring into being what "
"had not existed before" (p. 24). Liberty as a privilege had reference to a reli"
"gious fact of immunity from civil controls and regulations. Thus, the ancient p"
"rivilege of the church is its freedom from the state because it is Christ's per"
"sonal domain and body and hence subject to no controls but those of His law wor"
"d. Similarly, the privileges of the family exempted it from various controls. E"
"ach area of life had its privileges. We still use the word privilege in this ol"
"der sense when we speak of "privileged communication." A privileged communicati"
"on, as for example between a priest or pastor and a parishioner making a confes"
"sion or seeking counsel, or between a doctor and a patient, or a lawyer and a c"
"lient, is free from the controls or knowledge of the state or of other men and "
"agencies. This freedom and immunity is, moreover, a religious fact. Thus, the o"
"lder definition of liberty as a privilege and as a religious immunity rested fi"
"rmly and clearly on a Christian culture. As long as the education and culture o"
"f the Western World was clearly Christian, liberty or freedom remained a Christ"
"ian privilege."

msgid "This older meaning survived in the United States as recently as 1868, when the "
"Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution declared, "No state shall make or enfo"
"rce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the"
" United States." Unhappily, the Federal Government did not bar itself from any "
"such infringement of the people's "privileges or immunities." The annotated edi"

"que among constitutional provisions, the privileges and immunities clause of th"
"e Fourteenth Amendment enjoys the distinction of having been rendered a nullity"
" by a single decision of the Supreme Court issued within five years after its r"
"atification" in the Slaughter-House Cases. The Court at that time began also to"
" redefine the term "privileges and immunities" by declaring them to be, not rel"

"meaning. Its slogan was "Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality," and it soon became"
" apparent that all three had new, ugly, and murderous meaning. Not without reas"

", she cried out, "O Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name." All French"
