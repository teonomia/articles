msgid "A persistent myth cherished by humanistic man is to locate sin and the responsi"
"bility for it not in himself but in his environment, and in the ruling class. I"
"n every era, men have blamed their griefs and sins on the existing establishmen"
"t or power structure. To cite a few examples, during the "medieval" era, men fo"
"und it easy to see evil as the monopoly of rapacious churchmen, and the myth of"
" the greedy, lustful priest was fostered. True, some priests were evil, but, to"
" this day, we hear much about the sins of the priests and too little about the "
"sins of the people. No class has a monopoly on sin or virtue. There were many s"
"ensual priests, but only rarely are we told of the many women whose delight and"
" game was to seduce sexually innocent and dedicated priests. At a later date, w"
"e hear of the debauched royalty and nobility, who bled a people of their meager"
" means and dishonored their wives and daughters. Again it must be pointed out t"
"hat the royalty and nobility were freely robbed by those under them, and women "
"thrust themselves at them as a means to personal advancement. In the last centu"
"ry, when a young king went to a spa, the place was crowded by mothers and daugh"
"ters anxious to advance themselves as royal mistresses. The bourgeois also, on "
"attaining power, became the targets of the same mythical thinking. The brutal f"
"actory owners seduced working girls and cast them aside, according to the myth."
" Certainly, this happened, but as often as not every attempt was made to gain a"
"dvancement by seducing the factory owner, or his sons. The same was true of sla"
"very; slaves as often seduced and exploited their owners, as the owners their s"
"laves. Vice and virtue have never been the monopoly of a class, and it is only "
"mythological thinking that makes it so. In fact, a sure road to disintegration "
"and decline is for a ruling class to become sufficiently immoral to feed the my"
"th with a semblance of confirmation and thereby inflame reaction."

msgid "The myth of the monopoly of evil by the power structure is best promoted when t"
"he intellectuals and artists of a society become hostile to the rulers and then"
" promote hostility in their culture. Intellectuals and artists have been essent"
"ially a subsidized group in most societies. At first, the clergy supported them"
", and there are Biblical grounds for a close tie between the church and the art"
"s. However, as both intellectuals and artists saw themselves as the true elite "
"of a society, they then became of necessity the enemy of their rival, the curre"
"nt ruling class. Today, it is increasingly the state that subsidizes them, so t"

msgid "In the modern era, the monarchy and nobility were both excellent patrons and ea"
"sy targets. The evil of monarchy was not that its taxation was so great but tha"
"t its rule was so selectively restrictive. The monarchs taxed far less than mod"
"ern democracies do, and they generally ruled much less restrictively; their fai"
"ling was that their governments were restrictive of production and trade, and e"
"conomic progress was stifled thereby. The decline of monarchy was essentially a"
"n internal decline. Courts became no longer a place of justice, i.e., the natio"
"n's supreme court, but a place of social events. Louis XIV created the first "p"
"entagon" and bureaucracy of power, while turning his palace into a pleasure are"
"a to seduce the nobility away from power. Middle class men were used to rule, w"
"hile Louis XIV gave the forms of power to the nobility. The old upper class was"

"Richardson, "Sexual license had always been a privilege of the aristocracy, an "

" the bourgeoisie, the working class, the Communist movement, and the new left ("
"which turned on it's teachers), the intellectuals favor now the "adversary role"

" (Peter Steinfels, "The Counterintellectuals", in New American Review, no. 14, "

"e home" and be again the critic on the side-lines."
