" presupposes a religion, some form of "ultimate concern." Most religions are no"

"oral order is an aspect of religious order. Most religions are not theistic but"
" basically humanistic. From the structural perspective, religions can be divide"
"d into two great and central classes: theistic and political. In a theistic rel"
"igion, God is the source of morality and law. The order of the universe is God-"
"given and absolute, and man's order must be patterned in terms of God's infalli"
"ble word, the Bible. In political religion, politics is the source of morality "
"and law. Aristotle wrote on politics and therefore concerned himself with ethic"
"s, and his ethics is the morality of a political order. Ethics for Aristotle ba"
"sically has an immanent principle of ultimacy rather than a transcendental one."
" Instead of an absolute order in the universe, political religion sees a develo"
"ping order which can guide and control, so that God's eternal decree is replace"
"d by man's total planning. Man's predestination replaces predestination by God."
" Political morality has always been productive of political religions."

msgid "The second foundation of social order is the state. The state is the social org"
"anization of the creed, the legal structuring of the moral system of a society."
" The state cannot be amoral, because its every law is the codification of its b"
"asic morality. The state cannot be religiously neutral, because it is the relig"
"ious organization of society in terms of law. When the state claims religious n"
"eutrality, it is either self-deception or a deception of the people, and it mer"
"ely means a neutrality towards its old faith in order to prepare the way for th"
"e establishment of the new faith. The state is no less a religious organization"
" than the church, and in some societies more so. In Christian society, church a"
"nd state are both religious orders, the church as a ministry of grace and the s"
"tate as a ministry of justice. In pagan society, the state takes priority as th"
"e religious order: the temple or the shrine then become aspects of the state's "
"life and function. Religion can no more be abstracted from the state than from "
"the church. Churches and states may forsake a religion and abandon their creed,"
" but only in order to adopt a new one."

msgid "The purpose of the state varies in terms of its religion. Basically, the state "
"can be either messianic or ministerial, either a savior or a ministry of justic"
"e. For Biblical religion, the state is the ministry of justice; for non-Christi"
"an religions, for political religions, the state is man's savior. The two conce"
"pts are mutually exclusive, and there can be no compromise between them."

msgid "The third foundation of social order is sovereignty. Sovereignty can be either "
"transcendental or immanent, resting either in God or being an attribute of man "
"and his order. Basically, the two conflicting concepts are between God's sovere"
"ignty and the claimed sovereignty of the state. If God is sovereign, then He is"
" the creator and governor of all things, and His law over-arches, controls, jud"
"ges, and assesses all things; nothing can exist or have being apart from Him. I"
"f the state is sovereign, then the state must exercise total control and judgme"
"nt over all things in its world, or its sovereignty is limited and negated. The"
" state seeks, in terms of its claim to sovereignty, to become the determining a"
"nd over-arching power over every domain: no sphere is allowed to function excep"
"t by permission of the state. The earth, air, water, sky all belong to the stat"
"e, are used only under the law and tax of the state, and are potentially or act"
"ually subject to repossession by the state. The state has assumed that ultimacy"
" over man's life which properly belongs only to God. The creed of the state the"
"refore requires holy warfare against the Christian creed and faith."

msgid "Two absolute sovereignties and sovereigns cannot coexist at the same point in t"
"ime and space, claiming the same jurisdiction. Because the claims of God and th"
"e sovereign state are mutually exclusive, their conflict is inevitable. The war"
"fare between Christ and Caesar is inescapable war, and it is a war unto death."

msgid "For every sovereign order, sin and evil are a problem. Biblical Christianity de"
"als with sin and evil in two ways. First, the state as the ministry of justice "
"establishes restitution as the fundamental principle of the law. The justice of"
" God must be maintained; there must therefore be restitution by man whenever Go"
"d's order is in any way abated or breached, or else God will exact retribution "
"through His judgment. Second, the church as the ministry of grace must proclaim"
" the saving grace of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ makes atonement for man's sin a"
"gainst God, and He establishes the order of God in relation to man; this order "
"is communion in Him. Christ's atoning work affects restitution in relationship "
"to God, even as civil law under God must effect restitution in relationship to "
"man as its duty towards God. Thus, in a higher sense, both church and state hav"
"e a calling to effect godly restitution, the state as a ministry of justice, th"
"e church as a ministry of grace. The goal is "the restitution of all things" in"
" the new creation (Acts 3:21). Restitution is thus the basic aspect of the Chri"
"stian social order."

msgid "The fourth foundation of social order is thus grace. Man's problem under any cr"
"eed is the presence of personal and impersonal evil in the world. Man assesses "
"the nature of that evil and his answer to it is in terms of his creed. For poli"
"tical religions, for humanism, evil is in the environment, and the state's powe"
"r to change that environment is its saving grace. The state must remake man's p"
"hysical and spiritual environment in order to change and save man. Social chang"
