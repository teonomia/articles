msgid "A key aspect of idolatry is that an often otherwise legitimate aspect of this w"
"orld is made absolute. Very commonly, the state, which has a very limited but l"
"awful status under God is made into an idol and becomes, in Hegel's terms, God "
"walking on earth. This is idolatry. However, it is equally false to see the sta"
"te as absolute evil and the source of sin. It is the heart of man which is the "
"source of sin, and the state reflects our sins and our envious desires.The same"
" is true of wealth. It is not in and of itself good nor is it evil. It is man w"
"ho makes wealth either a good or an evil. Wealth can be a blessing from God, an"
"d a means whereby we can bless others, or it can be a witness to our lust for p"
"ower and a curse to others. Private wealth can capitalize a society, as it has "
"in Christendom, or it can decapitalize a society, as in old India, where the va"
"st wealth of the rajahs served only their pleasures. Attempts therefore to thin"
"k of wealth in isolation from God and His purposes lead us readily into idolatr"
"y. Wealth is made into an ultimate good or an ultimate evil, and the latter is "
"becoming all too common in our day. For some churchmen, the ultimate evil is to"
" be rich, especially a rich Christian in a hungry world. Some pastors actually "
"declare that it is a sin for any man to be paid more than $20,000 a year, or, a"
"s another holds, more then $40,000 a year,which may be his way of saying it is "
"a sin to make more than I do!Wealth, like all things else, must be understood i"
"n terms of God's purposes. Any consideration apart from that is not faithful to"
" Scripture. Again and again, the Bible speaks of God's concern for the poor, an"
"d we are told that the poor man is our brother, but it would be absurd to concl"
"ude that poverty is seen as a happy goal for man! Rather, we are told, if God's"
" people are faithful to His law, "there shall be no poor among you: for the LOR"
"D shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for a"
"n inheritance to possess it: Only if thou carefully harken unto the voice of th"
"e LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee th"
"is day" (Deut. 15:4-5). God thus designates the abolition of poverty as the goa"
"l of His law-word. To avoid the force of Deut. 15:4-5, all too many will cite M"
"atthew 26:11, "For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always."
"" All this means is that the Lord told the disciples that, during their lifetim"
"e, they would always have opportunities to minister to the poor, but not to His"
" physical person and presence.Over and over again, the Bible stresses the fact "
"that the godly seed must inherit the wealth, and that God's purpose in time is "
"that all the world's wealth pour into the Kingdom of God: "ye shall eat the ric"
"hes of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves" (Isa. 61:6)."
" God's purpose is that wealth capitalize the godly, and through them, His Kingd"
"om. This capitalization of the Kingdom of God means conversion, knowledge, tech"
"nology, and godly progress in every area of life and thought.The modern world, "
"however, is deeply committed to decapitalization because of the reign of envy. "
"Envy says, if I cannot be rich, let no other man be rich. Modern politics and e"
"conomics is governed by envy, and envy cloaks itself in the name of the welfare"
" of the poor.The world is now seeing the economic consequences of decapitalizat"
"ion. Through taxation and inflation, men's assets have been watered down and de"
"capitalized. We hear much talk about the wealth of the "big" corporations, and "
"too little about their precarious existence. Martin D. Weiss, in The Great Mone"
"y Panic (1981), points out that in 1973 General Motors and its subsidiaries had"
" an interest cost of 36 cents of every dollar of net profits. In 1979, interest"
" costs were 93 cents of every dollar of net profit. The cost of borrowed money "
"was almost equal to the money earned. The situation since has grown worse. In v"
"arying degrees all of the 500 major corporations in the United States save one "
"are in the same predicament. Probably the largest of all American corporations "
"is General Motors. How "big" is it? The press, the university, the pulpit, and "
"the media promote the idea of gigantism, as though our major corporations are r"
"ivals in size and wealth to the United States. However, as Michael Novak, in To"
"ward a Theology of the Corporation (1981), has pointed out, "Running a multinat"
"ional corporation in the Fortune 500 is, in most instances, about equivalent to"
" running a major university." The smallest of the 500 has only 529 employees; t"
"he largest, General Motors, has no more than 14,000 employees in Michigan; add "
"to this its over 200 units in over 177 congressional districts, and General Mot"
"ors still does not equal in size and wealth the University of California. The p"
"roblem with the corporations has not been their size and power but their coward"
"ice in the face of federal power and their too frequent compliance.The corporat"
"ions have been decapitalized by controls, taxation, and inflation, and the peop"
"le also. As long as inflation and fiat money continue, this decapitalization wi"
"ll continue. Each succeeding presidency has furthered this decapitalization in "
"the name of remedying it. To rob the people, every political scoundrel pleads a"
" great concern for the poor and the needy while never giving to any need out of"
" their own often considerable wealth.The central guilt, however, belongs to the"
" church. There is scarcely a seminary where liberation theolory, a sentimental "
"form of Marxism, is not taught. Catholic and Protestant seminaries and missiona"
"ry agencies are too often cesspools of liberation theology.The pulpit too is ra"
"dically delinquent. Where do we hear sermons on Matthew 23:14, "Woe unto you, S"
"cribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a prete"
"nce make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation." Our Lor"
"d here thunders out against an evil which was small compared to what is commonp"
"lace today, our confiscation by estate and inheritance taxes of the properties "
"rightfully belonging to widows and orphans. It is easy, in such contemporary in"
"stances, to feel a rage against the Internal Revenue Service, but this is to mi"
"ss the point. The I.R.S. is the agency of the voters' envy. Through Congress, w"
"e enact envy into law, and now that envy reaches into our pockets, we are angry"
". This is not to say that the I.R.S. is without guilt, but that the primary gui"
"lt rests with Congress and the people. The fact is that the majority of the peo"
"ple want out of envy to see their superiors hurt, even if it means their own hu"
"rt. A friend, while in a country in Europe, was discussing the confiscatory tax"
"ation of that nation and called attention to its destructiveness. His hosts def"
"ended the taxation, while agreeing as to its threat. Their reason? It's good to"
" see the high and mighty humbled.Octavio Paz, in The Labryinth of Solitude (196"
"1) said, "Marx wrote that all radicalism is a form of humanism, since man is th"
"e root of both reason and society. Thus every revolution tries to create a worl"
"d in which man, free at last from the trammels of the old regime, can express h"
"imself truly and fulfill his human condition. Man is a being who can realize hi"
"mself, and be himself, only in a revolutionary society."This revolutionary soci"
"ety is the goal of every humanistic state. Some hope to achieve it by violence,"
" others by democratic change. In either case, the goal is the same, man as god "
"or, more specifically, the humanistic state as god. Since one attribute of God "
"is creation, the modern state seeks to create wealth, cradle to grave or womb t"
"o tomb security, and also to create money. Modern money, fiat, paper money is t"
"he result. It is state created money which is used to erode all traditional for"
"ms of wealth, and to place all wealth under the control of the state. We see to"
"day small family farms, in the same family for generations or from the colonial"
" era, being sold because of taxes. This disaster is also taking place in Britai"
"n and elsewhere.Godly wealth in Scripture is in terms of the faithful developme"
"nt of potentialities under God. God created the world, and He created the possi"
"bility of wealth through its natural resources, the earth's fertility, and the "
"mind of man. Creation and all its ingredients are the handiwork of the triune G"
"od and none other. It is His law therefore which is the only true ground for go"
"dly wealth. The Lord condemns all trust in wealth as a form of humanism, as a k"
"ind of worship of the creation of our own hands rather than the Creator of all."
"This, however, is the kind of wealth the modern state regards as alone acceptab"
"le, a state-created, humanistic wealth. Instead of being defined in terms of so"
"me God-given aspect of creation, gold, silver, land, or other assets, all wealt"
"h is to be reduced to state-created paper. Now the value of money is its liquid"
"ity which makes for its ready and easy use. When the modern hyper-taxing state "
"creates a paper money inflation, it thereby requires every other form of wealth"
" to be equally liquid. The family farm is no longer an inheritance from the pas"
"t to the future generations; it is converted from a stable form of wealth to a "
"highly unstable and liquid form by paper money, inflation and taxation. In the "
"years of limited state power, the tax on a family farm in many areas was a few "
"dollars at most. After World War II, many farmers were shocked when their taxes"
" hit $25 and then $50; now they run into the thousands of dollars. At present, "
"a growing number of American farmers are in serious trouble because of the comb"
"ination of high taxes and debts they cannot repay. In the United States, every "
"economic crisis has been preceded by a farm crisis.Decapitalization is a world-"
"wide fact today. In the Soviet Union, it is far gone, and not for the first tim"
"e. In 1939, Stalin's Russia was bankrupt; by means of World War II, it recapita"
"lized itself through an act of piracy approved by Roosevelt and Churchill. The "
"Soviet Union was allowed to seize Central Europe, cannibalize East Germany and "
"Poland, and more. Since then, the Soviet Union has been recapitalized annually "
"by aid from the United States, and from American and European banks, These loan"
"s have been even more profitable than the seizure of Central Europe perhaps. Ho"
"wever, both by its foreign and its domestic policies, the United States has bee"
"n decapitalizing itself. A socialistic economy is a parasitic one: its continue"
"d life depends on the life of the host. Both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. are toda"
"y parasites living off the American people. There is no future for the American"
" people until they rid themselves of the parasites, which means a radical chang"
"e of perspective with regard to the nature of civil government.Unless we have f"
"reedom under God and in obedience to Him, our definition of wealth is born of h"
"unger, not of bounty. One American, long a prisoner in the Soviet Union, saw we"
"alth as one potato, and two potatoes as undreamed of wealth. A refugee couple f"
"rom Cambodia celebrated their wedding anniversary in the Cambodian jungle with "
"an unexpected and welcome gift in their hunger, a rat's skin shared with them, "
"to boil into a broth. A decapitalized (and unfree) society redefines wealth in "
"pathetic terms. To each according to his needs, Marx held, and the Marxists hav"
"e reduced the level of needs 10 beggarly dimensions. They have redefined wealth"
" to make it the legitimate possession of the state and none other.Redefinition "
"has occurred in many areas. Students are routinely taught that there is an econ"
"omic distinction between consumption and investment. Franklin W. Ryan, and Dr. "
"Elgin Groseclose, in his excellent America's Money Machine: The Story of the Fe"
"deral Reserve System, show otherwise. (The family is called by them the greates"
"t production enterprise in society, and yet we are today at war against the fam"
"ily.) If I feed myself and my family, I am investing in our future; if I use ju"
"nk food, I am making a poor investment. Whatever money I spend on the family is"
" either a good or bad investment or consumption. To indict the idea of consumpt"
"ion is absurd; there is good consumption and unsound consumption.The point of i"
"t all is that we are seeing an assault on and an erosion of the Biblical doctri"
"ne of wealth and stewardship. In its place, the state as the new god wants to r"
"emake man and society, and it believes that it can also create wealth by legisl"
"ation, taxation, redistribution, and controls. What the modern state is accompl"
"ishing instead is the erosion of true wealth, and morality as well. The modern "
"state has become history's great devourer of widows' houses, while it talks pio"
"usly of a love for the poor, and the church is largely silent in the face of th"
"is growing evil. The sure promise of God to all such is judgement, unless men s"
"eparate themselves from these evil ones to the Lord, Who says to us today as Mo"
"ses did when Israel worshipped the golden calf, "Who is on the LORD'S side? Let"
" him come unto me" (Ex. 32:26). (March, 1982)"
