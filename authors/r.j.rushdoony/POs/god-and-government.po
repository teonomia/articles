"	Deuteronomy was the most influential book in Old Testament history becaus"
"e of the use of it by the prophets. Its stress on possession of the land had a "
"powerful effect, and it is an emphasis needed now, because we have separated fa"
"ith and the land, faith and possession of the earth. God having done certain th"
"ings for His people requires therefore certain things of them. True faith must "
"have works: faith means vision and action. A static faith is dead. God told His"
" people at Sinai, "Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount" (v. 6). God's alter"
"natives are moving forward or death."

"	Where God commands us, He empowers us to do His will. As Davies observed,"
" "Human power is formal - God's power real."[2] Throughout Deuteronomy, Moses i"

" God" (v. 10), and so on. Failure to act in terms of God's promises had thirty-"
"eight years earlier led to defeat. As the marginal comment in the Geneva Bible "
"reads, "the fault was in themselves, that they did not sooner possess the inher"
"itance promised."[3] The old term applied in Judaism to Deuteronomy was correct"
": it is "a book of reproofs.""

"	In. vv. 9-16, the required form of government in church and state is set "

"rom the top down. Rule by an elite at the top is an ancient pattern as well as "
"a modern one. In Plato's Republic, it is held to be the only valid form, i.e., "
"rule by philosopher-kings. These men are an unelected elite; they are under no "
"law: their will determines all things. This is, of course, the pattern of Marxi"

"2). Where God's law and grace are rejected, the systems of government devised b"
