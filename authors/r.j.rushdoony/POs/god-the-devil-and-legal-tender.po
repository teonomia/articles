msgid "God, The Devil, and Legal TenderBy R. J. RushdoonyJanuary 07, 2013"
msgstr ""

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "To view the idea of legal tender theologically seems strange to the modern (and"
" humanistic) mind, but it was once an important issue in the United States. The"
" legal tender doctrine holds that the power to define legal money belongs to th"
"e state, and the state can therefore declare what constitutes legal money for t"
"he payment of all debts, public and private."
msgstr ""

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "The Rev. John Witherspoon attacked the idea very early. It was unnecessary for "
"any state to require people to accept good money. Gold and silver were always a"
"cceptable. A legal tender law simply requires people to accept bad money, and i"
"t does take civil coercion to make bad money acceptable."

msgid "The U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 10, states that no state can make "an"
"ything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts." The Federalist, "
"no. 44, gives us Madison's opposition to paper money. Patrick Henry opposed pap"
"er money, and Daniel Webster argued that a legal tender law is unconstitutional"

msgid "It was the lexicographer and Calvinist Noah Webster who spoke most bluntly. In "
"1790, Webster called a tender law "the devil." He warned, "My countrymen, the d"
"evil is among you." Of legislators who favored legal tender laws, he said that "
"honest men should exclaim, "You are rogues, and the devil is in you!" Legal ten"
"der laws, he pointed out, were the preliminary to adulterated money, and all th"
"ose who favored them were counterfeiters, deserving of the gallows, or at least"
" the whipping post!"

""Remember that past contracts are sacred things; that legislatures have no"
" right to interfere with them; they have no right to say that a debt shall be p"
"aid at a discount, or in any manner which the parties never intended. It is the"
" business of justice to fulfill the intentions of parties in contracts, not to "
"defeat them. To pay bona fide contracts for cash, in paper of little value, or "
"in old horses, would be a dishonest attempt in an individual; but for legislatu"

msgid "For Webster and others, gold and silver represented natural and hence a God-giv"
"en order of things, whereas legal tender creates an arbitrary value which can o"
"nly stand with coercion. Values are God-created, not man or state created. The "
"temptation of Satan in the beginning was to doubt God's order: "Yea, hath God s"
"aid?" (Gen. 3:1). Rather, the tempter suggested a new order in which man create"
"s his own laws, values, and morality: every man shall be his own god, determini"
"ng or knowing good and evil for himself (Gen. 3:5). In such a society, the stat"
"e as man incarnate can set aside God's laws and make its own laws. It can issue"
" a legal tender law and require obedience to it. (In God's natural order, there"
" is no need to require the use of gold and silver; they commend themselves and "
"are in demand.)"

"is the new god walking on earth, and demanding totalitarian powers and command."
