"	When the Supreme Court, in early June, 1985, ruled against prayer in the "
""public" schools, even if it were silent prayer, there was much jubilation in h"
"umanistic circles and some dismay in church responses. Prayer in state schools "
"dedicated to humanism and anti-Christianity was in itself no great advantage. P"
"rayer in these schools for illiteracy and paganism would be inappropriate, as w"
"ould be mandatory prayers in houses of prostitution. How can there be a blessin"
"g on the systematic neglect of the triune God? If faith without works is dead ("
"James 2:14-26), so too is prayer without works. We cannot ask God to bless what"
" is against His will, nor us if we are where we ought not to be."

" Ruling Sound" (p.12): "The Know-Nothings are at it already, calling the latest"
" Supreme Court ruling on prayer in the schools ‘an act of war against this nati"

"	It is emphatically true that the U.S. Constitution held "that government "
"can neither promote or proscribe" religious practice on the federal level. In r"
"ecent years, this has been extended to the states. The premise of this perspect"
"ive is that God's Kingdom cannot be controlled by the state. The early church f"
"ought for this, as did the medieval and the modern church. Limits were thereby "
"placed on the power and jurisdiction of the state, limits which the courts now "

"	The central evil of the modern view is that "religion is a private, perso"
"nal matter." This is a revolutionary idea, a product of the modern era and of r"
"evolutionary ideologies. Basic to the western world has been the premise that, "
"because the God of the Scriptures is the living God, the Maker of heaven and ea"
"rth and all things therein, any attempt to establish man and society apart from"
" Him and His law is suicidal. Because the triune God is the way, the truth, and"
" the life (John 14:6), any attempt to establish anything apart from Him is a li"
"e and a deadly venture (Ps. 127:l; Prov. 8:36). In terms of this, the free exer"
"cise of religion is a necessity in order that the wellsprings of human life be "
