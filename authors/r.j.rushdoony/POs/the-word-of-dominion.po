msgid "As usual, Van Til puts his finger clearly on the basic point. Man was created f"
"or God’s service, to be His priest, prophet, and king and to make of this earth"
" God’s developed and glorious kingdom. This calling is basic to man’s nature. F"
"allen man does not abandon this calling. Instead, he seeks to convert it to his"
" own perverse goal, to establish the kingdom of Man with man as god and as the "
"ultimate point of reference. The beginning of that revolt is the question, “Yea"
", hath God said?” (Gen. 3:1). The authoritative and infallible word, the word o"
"f dominion, the tempter held, is not from God but from the creature. The task o"
"f exercising dominion and subduing the earth will be made easier, he held, if m"
"an begins by denying God’s word and asserting his own word as the word of knowl"
"edge and the word of dominion. By reserving the tree of knowledge to Himself, G"
"od reserved dominion to Himself. God declared thereby that the interpretation o"
"f facts and the moral character of all things was determined by His word. God’s"
" word is the word of dominion because His is the creative word. Having made all"
" things, He has established the character, meaning, and purpose of all things. "
"Good and evil are determined by His being and purpose, so that the ultimate poi"
"nt of reference in all things is God and His word, the binding word and the wor"
"d of dominion."

msgid "The tempter’s belief was and is that the creature, in order to fulfil his calli"

"man requires man to be god. Man must therefore become his own source of the wor"
"d of dominion; man must declare that things are good and evil insofar as they s"
"erve or do not serve man’s purpose and glory. Man must begin the construction o"
"f his true kingdom, the kingdom of Man, by declaring that he himself is the tre"

msgid "Note that Van Til points out, “In saving us from sin, Christ saves us unto his "
"service.” Arminian salvation serves fallen man; it “frees” him supposedly from "
"the consequences of the fall to pursue his own independent way in building the "
"kingdom of Man. But salvation is not merely fire insurance, and preaching which"
" stresses heaven and hell as motives for salvation is clearly humanistic and se"
"rves the interests of fallen man. It is worshipping and serving the creature ra"
"ther than the Creator (Rom. 1:25). The call to salvation is a word of command f"
"rom the sovereign God to cease from our self-service and self-worship and to se"
