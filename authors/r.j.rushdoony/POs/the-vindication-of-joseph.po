"nt from the status of the favored son to that of a slave, to that of prime mini"

"t commit (Gen. 39:7–20, 41:1). There is no record that his false imprisonment c"
"onviction was ever reversed; Pharaoh was interested in what Joseph could do for"

"unrighted in history. Our Lord requires us to devote ourselves to His service, "
"not to our vindication. In the end, He, as the great Judge of all men and natio"
"ns, will right every wrong and close all books with justice."
