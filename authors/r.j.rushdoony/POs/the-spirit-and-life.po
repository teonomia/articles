"ovely grounds and beautiful building house a remarkable school of amazing calib"

"s. The case of one particular student especially interested me. This boy entere"
"d the fourth grade there in September of 1969. The parents had been newly trans"
"planted to Washington, D.C., and they had a problem: the boy was obviously reta"
"rded, as public school records for the first three grades indicated. Would the "
"school take him until they could locate a special school at a later date? The s"
"chool did, and the boy began to develop. At the end of the fourth grade, psycho"
"logists tested the boy. His I.Q. was very low, only 67, but he tested at grade "
"level and above in all subjects in terms of a standard achievement test."

"erior and thoroughly Christian teachers, was partly the reason. But St. Paul st"

":6). The mere form of religion, Paul declared, is dead and kills man’s hopes, b"
"ut the Spirit of God gives life. Man may go through the motions, but without Go"
