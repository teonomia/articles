"doony points out that the Bible does not give us a multiplicity of facts which "
"make up mathematics, paleontology, physics, biology, or any other subject, but "
"it does give us "the truth about all facts." It declares all facts to be God-cr"

"Teaching Bible should be done with knowledge and wisdom. The Bible is God"
"'s revelation to man; it has as its purpose the communication by God to man of "
"God's purpose and salvation. In teaching the Bible, it should be remembered, fi"
"rst, that the Christian school is a school, not a church. Its essential functio"
"n is education, not evangelism. The two must not be confused. In some schools, "
"the goal of the Bible class is conversion, as a result, instruction suffers, an"
"d grading tends to be in terms of a response rather than a solid knowledge of S"
"cripture. The teacher's job is to instruct and to grade; the evangelist's funct"
"ion is to present the plan of salvation with conviction and regeneration as the"
" goal. The evangelist's "grading" is different. The best foundation for evangel"
"ization is laid by solid instruction. Scripture declares, "Faith cometh by hear"
"ing, and hearing by the word of God" (Rom. 10:17). There is no better human ins"
"trument possible to assure a hearing ear than the Christian School and sound cl"
"asses therein.Second, the class should be given a clear-cut view of Biblical hi"
"story and doctrine. Most Sunday school instruction is almost useless, because t"
"he average child has little sense of the unity of Scripture or of Bible chronol"
"ogy. Sunday school instruction is usually full of gimmicks to command interest,"
" is a form of baby-sitting, and is too often a disaster to Christ's cause. The "
"Christian School must make the Bible Class, above all, highly disciplined and t"
"horough.Third, Christian education can never be abstract. Our study ...must be "
"historical and concrete. This also means that it then fulfills God's purpose. S"
"olomon, in speaking of the goads and nails of teaching, says "Let us hear the c"
"onclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is"
" the whole duty of man" (Eccls. 12:13). We teach the Bible; we teach the plan o"
"f salvation therein, and the way of salvation. We teach: the rest is left to th"
"e Holy Spirit and the ministry of the word...\n"
"Then, fourth, we must always"
" remember that the Bible is not only the word of God but also the most exciting"
" book there is. Our teaching should not deaden the excitement, beauty, and powe"
"r of the Bible.\n"
"An illustration of a common obliviousness to this aspect o"
"f Scripture comes from a pre-World War II England. In a school chapel, the dail"
"y readings followed the Episcopal lectionary, which divides Acts 27 into severa"
"l readings [extending over weeks -A.S.]. A boy without a Christian background, "
"or else no knowledge of Scripture, was asked to read Acts 27:1-26. He continued"
" to read beyond the appointed text. When the headmaster attempted to stop him, "
"the boy told him to be quiet, because he wanted to see what happened. Would the"
"re be a shipwreck, and would the passengers be saved? The boy was reading the B"
"ible intelligently. Too often, we ask people to study it in unintelligent terms"
", as though it were not a remarkably stirring book.Fifth, the Bible should be r"
"ead and studied as the word of the living God, an infallible and inerrant word,"
" because no other word is possible from the sovereign and omniscient God. It is"
" this book that governs Christian education and the Christian School. The teach"
"er must grow in terms of that book in order to teach it properly. If our unders"
"tanding of the Bible does not grow continually, we are not competent to teach B"
"ible. Only those who feel its power and excitement can communicate it, and only"
" those who know the God of Scripture can teach the truth about it."
