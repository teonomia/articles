msgid "Our Lord declares, “He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear th"
"em not, because ye are not of God” (John 8:47). In other words, our hearing dep"
"ends upon our faith; our lack of faith will make it impossible for us to hear w"
"hat God says. Because God’s Word is an indictment of fallen man, man rejects it"
" and closes his mind to it. What we are determines how we hear, and also how we"
" speak. In 1364, Petrarch wrote of the visit of a philosopher who came to him i"
"n his library. Petrarch said of him, “He was one of those who think they live i"
"n vain unless they are constantly snarling at Christ or his divine teachings.” "
"In the midst of a Christian civilization, this philosopher would only listen to"
" the followers of Averroes, not of Christ."

"e the turmoil, pride, and sin of men’s hearts will be expressed daily."
