msgid "Foundations are one of the most important, abused, and misunderstood aspects of"
" our contemporary scene. Most large foundations are strongly oriented to statis"
"m, and virtually all the rest are too afraid of losing their tax-exemption to d"
"o more than drift with the current. But foundations have a central and basic pl"
"ace in Christian history. To understand them, let us examine briefly the ancien"
"t pagan state."

msgid "The pagan state was a totalitarian divine-human order: the state was a god walk"
"ing on earth. Its divinity might be manifested in the person of the ruler, or h"
"is office, or the state or people as a whole, but this divinity was believed to"
" be there. There was no freedom from the state: everything was absolutely under"
" state control, whether in China, India, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, or Rome. Relig"
"ion was merely a department of state."

msgid "The one exception was the Commonwealth of God's people, Israel. God and His law"
"-order were accorded sovereignty over all things by all true believers. God's p"
"rophets could rebuke kings, because even apostate men were aware of the soverei"
"gn word and its power. The tyrant Ahab had to be nagged by his foreign wife, Je"
"zebel, to act against the prophets."

msgid "The church in the Roman Empire could have readily become a recognized and legal"
" religion by offering incense to Caesar and acknowledging his sovereignty. This"
" the church refused to do. The Christians as citizens were ready to submit to C"
"aesar in all matters of civil justice, but in those areas where God gave the st"
"ate no jurisdiction they obeyed God. The Biblical faith is not in the state as "
"an over-arching, all-governing institution which takes all others under its win"
"gs, but in God's sovereign and over-arching law-order, under which church, stat"
"e, school, family, vocation, and all things else exist as separate yet interdep"
"endent spheres of life. The state has no more legitimate right to govern the ch"
"urch and school than it has to govern the laws of mathematics and physics, and "
"the realm of the church is similarly restricted. The realm of the state is just"
"ice and order under God; the realm of the church is the ministry of the word an"
"d the sacraments and the discipline of its body; the realm of the school is the"
" development of learning and knowledge under God; and so on."

"t, the state at first tried ruthlessly to exterminate all Christians. For a tim"

"lines of condemned Christians. Later, when extermination failed, infiltration a"

msgid "But Christianity began to create a new society, a decentralized and free societ"

"ns were free and independent agencies, free of church and state, dedicated to s"
"pecific purposes: charity and welfare, hospitals and medicine, education, orpha"
"nages, missions, and so on. These foundations began to accumulate wealth to ful"
"fil these purposes. The history books tell us that, by the end of the so-called"
" "middle ages" much of the wealth of Europe was in the hands of the church. The"

" disapproval of the neoplatonic pagan flight of the hermits from the world. In "
"fact, in 819, the Council of Aix made it plain that the Christian duty of monas"
"tery communities or foundations was to care for the poor, or, in one way or ano"
