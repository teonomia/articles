"e plainly declares, “They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as k"

"If men abandon it, they are deserting not only law but righteousness and justic"

" the commission of a crime, the other with a car he had stolen before witnesses"
". They were planning to plead innocent and were going to be provided with publi"
"c defenders at taxpayers’ expense; those robbed would get no return, in one cas"
"e for stolen funds and in the other case for a possibly damaged car. There was "
"no thought in the court or law of the Biblical law of restitution. The penalty "
"was being paid by the victims in many hours lost in the courtroom, lost goods, "
"and taxes paid. The criminals, both with records, were dealt with gently, lest "
"it prejudice the case, and the victims and police were questioned at times shar"
"ply."
