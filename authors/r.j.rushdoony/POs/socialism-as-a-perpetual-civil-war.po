msgid "Socialism and communism presuppose that their system represents the true order "
"of the ages and is the answer to man’s problems. This assumption is one that as"
"sumes man’s problems to be not spiritual but material, not sin but environment."
" Change man’s environment and you will then remake man, it is held. The answer "
"to man’s problems is therefore not the spiritual regeneration of man by Jesus C"
"hrist but the reorganization of society by the scientific socialist state."

" system of thought has an infallibility concept, but few are honest enough to a"
"dmit it. Ultimate, final, and inerrant authority is vested somewhere in the sys"
"tem as the basic and assured arbiter of truth or reality. The scientific social"
"istic state sees scientific socialism as the infallible truth of history; its a"
"pplication ensures the perfect social order. If failures occur in scientific so"
"cialist states, it is not the fault of scientific socialism, which is by defini"
"tion infallible and true, but of the hostile people, remnants of the capitalist"
"ic class, or traitorous members of the party. Because the scientific socialist "
"state cannot blame itself, it must wage civil war against some portion of the s"
"tate. Thus, first of all, socialism’s answer to every problem is civil war. Som"
"eone is guilty, but never socialism itself."

msgid "Fifth, perpetual civil warfare means in some form perpetual violence or repress"
"ive force, and as a result, the use of terror is not only accepted but is often"
" justified and exalted. Terror is defended and upheld as necessary to suppress "
"the enemies of the pe\n"
"ople and to protect the state from destruction. Jean-"
"Paul Sartre, in his Critique of Dialectical Reason, spoke of terror as “the ver"
"y bond of fraternity.” Terror is made a moral principle and an inevitable requi"
"rement of history. As a result, “total terror” is practiced as a necessary and "
"moral requirement of scientific socialism. Incredible brutality, barbarism, sav"
"agery, and degeneracy become the products of scientific socialism.2 Thus, the p"
"erpetual civil warfare that the scientific socialist state wages against its pe"
"ople is also a form of total warfare. It is more radical than total warfare, in"
" that normal total warfare is for a stated period of hostilities, whereas the s"
"ocialistic civil war and its terroristic total warfare have no end. It is a per"
"petual threat to the people, and, in varying degrees, continuously practiced. T"
"he more the state approaches total socialism, to that same degree it also appro"
"aches total terror and total civil war. It is this aspect of perpetual and tota"
"l warfare that has made socialists like George Orwell, author of 1984, turn fro"
"m socialism in horror, without believing really in anything else. Theirs is not"
" a conversion but simply revulsion from terror."
