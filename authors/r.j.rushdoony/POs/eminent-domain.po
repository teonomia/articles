msgid "The doctrine of eminent domain is a basic but unexamined concept of civilizatio"
"n, an idea assumed without question by most people as a necessary evil. A simpl"
"e definition is in order by way of introduction, and the second edition of the "
"Merriam-Webster dictionary provides a convenient one:"

msgid "Eminent domain. Law. That superior dominion of the sovereign power over all the"
" property within the state which authorizes it to appropriate all or any part t"
"hereof to a necessary public use, reasonable compensation being made. The oblig"
"ation to give compensation is considered by the best authorities as being incid"
"ent to the right of eminent domain, and not an imposed limitation. The right of"
" eminent domain is usually carefully distinguished from that of taxation and th"
"e police power. In Great Britain the compulsory acquisition of land for public "
"or semi-public purposes is governed by statute, and is called compulsory purcha"
"se in England; in Scotland the transaction is called compulsory surrender. Some"
" consider an analogous right, wider than angary, to exist in international law "
"for one nation to appropriate the territory or property of another as a necessa"
"ry measure of self-protection."

msgid "Eminent domain is thus an attribute of ultimate sovereignty, and therefore it i"
"s an attribute of divinity. According to the Bible, “The earth is the Lord’s” ("
"Ps. 24:1), and He therefore has total dominion over it. Because “[t]he earth is"
" the Lord’s,” God requires the whole world to submit to His law and regards all"
" things as subject to total control, confiscation, or regulation by His soverei"
"gn power and Word (Exod. 9:29, 19:5; Deut. 10:14; Ps. 50:12; 1 Cor. 10:26, 28)."
" As God declared to Job, “Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whats"
"oever is under the whole heaven is mine” (Job 41:11). The premise of the Bible "
"is God’s assertion of total sovereignty over all creation and all men. The Mosa"
"ic law claimed total sovereignty for God and the jurisdiction of His law over a"
"ll persons, Israelite and foreigner, within the boundaries of the nation (Deut."
" 31:12), but those outside the law of the covenant were not thereby outside God"
"’s jurisdiction. The judgment of all the nations is repeatedly proclaimed, prec"
"isely because God’s sovereignty extends over all nations. “Under Scriptural law"
", all property — the whole earth — belongs to God, who is the only owner of pro"
"perty”[1] in any ultimate and sovereign sense. Man holds title under God."

msgid "In the Biblical law, the state has no right of eminent domain, and no right to "
"tax the land. “It was impossible to dispossess men of their inheritance under t"
"he law of the Lord as no taxes were levied against land.”[2] The tithe was God’"
"s tax, not a gift to God. The state was limited to a tax resembling the tithe, "
"a tax on increase, not on the land itself.[3] God as sovereign confiscated the "
"land when the Israelites became apostate, even as He dispossesses and destroys "
"all peoples for their failure to acknowledge His dominion and sovereignty. The "
"marks of a tyrant and a supplanter of God’s kingship over a people was specifie"
"d as oppressive taxation, and the confiscation of land by eminent domain (1 Sam"
". 8)."

msgid "For the state to claim the right of eminent domain is therefore a claim to divi"
"ne right. Eminent domain is not, as some jurists would hold, a pragmatic and ne"
"cessary law, but a lively survival of the ancient claim to divinity by the stat"
"e. The fact that people are not aware of the significance of eminent domain doe"
"s not reduce its significance to the slightest degree. The state, in claiming e"
"minent domain, is simply asserting “sovereign power over all property within th"
"e state,” to cite Webster again, and compensation for such seized properties is"
" “incident to” but not an essential part of “the right of eminent domain.” And "
"today, in the average American city there are about 50 agencies that have the p"
"ower to confiscate land.[4]"

msgid "The right of eminent domain, then, is a divine right and power. Moreover, there"
" are no degrees of divinity: divinity is a total concept. A deity is either div"
"ine, or he is not; he is either a god, or he is not. Thus, when the state lays "
"claim to divinity, it lays claim to a total power. The right of eminent domain "
"ostensibly limits the state to the confiscation of properties necessary to the "
"common good or to the public welfare. But the state is the judge of the common "
"good and public welfare, and so the power of eminent domain expands steadily to"
"ward the total possession by the state of all properties within the state. The "
"state, being viewed as the higher or supreme power, and the possessor of eminen"
"t domain, is seen as the natural guardian and agency of public welfare. In term"
"s of this presupposition, private ownership is seen as hostile to the common go"
"od, whereas state ownership advances the public welfare. With this philosophy, "
"total confiscation is simply a question of time. The right of eminent domain, t"
"herefore, by associating a “necessary common use” or good with the state, makes"
" the state into a benevolent god whose control and ownership are necessary to t"
"he welfare of man."

msgid "It is impossible to understand the Bible apart from its assertion of God’s sole"
" eminent domain over every realm. The cleansing of the Temple by Jesus, both at"
" the beginning and end of His ministry, was an assertion of His eminent domain "
"over the church. His condemnation of Jerusalem (Matt. 24:1ff.), His declaration"
" that the Kingdom of God was taken from Israel and given to another (Matt. 21:4"
"3), His assertion of divine Kingship before the Sanhedrin (Matt. 26:64), and Hi"
"s declaration of His Kingship before Pilate (John 18:33–37), were all assertion"
"s of eminent domain over the state, whether Judea or Rome. His triumphal entry "
"into Jerusalem was begun with an act of eminent domain and confiscation. Discip"
"les were sent to a neighboring village to get a colt. There was no promise of p"
"ayment or return. They were merely to assert: “The Lord hath need of him” (Luke"
" 19:28–48). He blasted the fig tree (or Israel) later in the week, asserting Hi"
"s eminent domain over both nature and the state. The “vineyard” or Kingdom of G"
"od was His to bestow, and man’s life was His to bless, or to destroy (Luke 22:9"
"–16)."

msgid "Sovereignty and eminent domain are inescapable concepts. Denied to God, they wi"
"ll accrue to men. Today Caesar is taking the sovereignty men will not allow to "
"God. Sovereignty is supremacy in rule and power, and eminent domain is an aspec"
"t of sovereignty. Sovereignty cannot be avoided: it will either be reserved to "
"God, or it will accrue to men. With the anarchists, sovereignty is reserved to "
"the individual man; within the statists, it is reserved to the state. In either"
