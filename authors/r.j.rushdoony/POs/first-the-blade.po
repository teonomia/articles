""For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself: first the blade, then the ear, "
"after that the full corn in the ear." Our Lord tells us (Mark 4:26-29) that the"
" Kingdom of God, as it develops in history, has a necessary growth and developm"
"ent. No more than we can plant grain and then expect the harvest at once, can w"
"e expect quick or immediate results in the growth of God's Kingdom. If we plant"
" grain, we must cultivate it, often water it, tend to the field, and, only afte"
"r much labor, reap a harvest. To expect otherwise is stupidity and foolishness,"
" whether in farming or in the work of the Kingdom. In fact, our Lord describes "
"quick growth as false (Matt. 13:5-6, 20-21)."
