" and just acts created all things, then all things are derivative from God's ac"
"t, dependent on His Being, and subject to His total government and predestinati"
"on. If God is the Creator, He is also the determiner and the lawgiver. If the u"
"niverse was "created" by an accident, out of nothing, then nothing external to "
"it can determine it. Whatever possibility there is of any determination in the "
"cosmos must then come from that cosmos. The title of a book published in the mi"
"d-twentieth century and long in print, Man Makes Himself, by V. G. Childe, stat"
"es the matter clearly. If the origin of things is from within the cosmos, then,"
" possibly, the control of all things can come from something within that cosmos"
". This faith leads to man playing God, to man attempting to control evolution, "
"to a belief in a world state controlling all things, and to a religious belief "
"in the powers of time and process."
