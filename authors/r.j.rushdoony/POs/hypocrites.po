" This does not make them any the less serious, nor any the less destructive. Th"
"e hypocrite is not against sin as such. It is not all lawlessness and the princ"
"iple of lawlessness which he hates. The hypocrite can be against many particula"
"r sins, in fact, against almost all sins, but he will nurse, protect, and justi"
"fy his particular sins. The hypocrite is thus mainly against sins when other pe"
"ople commit them, not when he does. Because he is against so much sin (by other"
" people), the hypocrite assumes that he is righteous. But righteousness is not "
"gained by condemning the sins of other people, but by grace, and by obedience t"
"o the law-word of God. The hypocrite is against sin in other people. The godly "
"man is against sin anywhere but, first and foremost, against sin in himself."
