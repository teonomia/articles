"r years of elementary school, but not very pleasantly. It was a statement by a "
"prominent “authority” that we have only enough coal, oil, and gas in the world’"

"years ago in a classroom! I was also told that the new weapons of warfare would"
" lead to the obliteration of the human race if a second world war began, and th"
"at man’s hope was in something called, I think, the Kellogg-Briand Peace Pact, "
"which almost all nations signed, promising to end all wars, and in the League o"

" going to happen to the human race unless something or other was done. Since th"
