"	The doctrine of Karma is one of the most important religious doctrines in"
"vented by man. Its origins are Brahmanic, but its great development is Buddhist"
". Perhaps no other non-Biblical doctrine is more important and more perceptive,"
" however deadly. Karma is the law of cause and effect as it regulates the prese"
"nt and future life of man. Karma says that what a man sows, that shall he also "
"reap; every man inherits his own burden of sin and guilt, and no man can inheri"
"t the good or evil acts of another man. Karma holds that sin cannot be destroye"
"d by sacrifice, penance, or repentance, but only by self-expiation. A man thus "
"spends his life (and future reincarnations, according to this doctrine) working"
" out the atonement for sin. The important fact about Karma is that this doctrin"
"e does justice to the reality of cause and effect; it recognizes the reality of"
" sin in man, and the burden which sin imposes on the present and the future. Mo"
"dern humanism is unable to cope with this fact of causality and chooses to igno"
"re it. It does not escape causality thereby and only compounds its problem."

"	The doctrine of karma was current in the world of the Bible, especially t"

"RD; and be sure your sin will find you out” (Num. 32:23). Paul warns, “Be not d"
"eceived; God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also rea"
"p” (Gal. 6:7). However, rather than an abstract world of causality, for the Bib"
"le the cosmos is the creation of the personal God. This fact creates a vast gul"

"	The two principles of Karma are, first, “A man is born into the world tha"
"t he has made,” and second, “The Deed does not perish,” i.e., consequences cont"
"inue until they are fully expiated. Karma cannot be destroyed, neither by fire,"
" flood, wind, or the gods. It must proceed unrelentingly and unerringly to its "
"results. A man might briefly postpone the workings of his Karma, but he could n"
"ever frustrate nor destroy them. All else passes, but acts and their consequenc"
"es remain. Destiny, Karma, reigns and rules. The word deva is gods, and daiva, "
"derived from it, means destiny, and, for the Buddhist, destiny is simply past a"
"cts, according to L. de la Vallee Poussin. Since Karma includes in its unrelent"
"ing causality mental acts as well, man’s waking thoughts as well as his dreams "
"in sleep govern his life and add to his Karma. Only through good acts can man e"
"xpiate his past sins, and “the good act has three roots: the absence of lust, o"
"f hatred, and of error” (Poussin). Thus, we have a negative idea of good, so th"
"at its essential function is to diminish the retribution for the vast accumulat"
"ion of past acts."

"	The very clear fact which emerges from this is that, in the world of Karm"
"a, there can be passivity and withdrawal, but definitely not rest. The Biblical"
" doctrine of the Sabbath is thus unique. We are commanded to observe the Sabbat"
"h in Deuteronomy and to “remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt"
", and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and b"
"y a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the Sa"
"bbath Day” (Deut. 5:15). Redeemed man can rest because he knows that the Lord h"
"as saved him. The meaning of the cross is not that the consequences of our sin "
"are simply overlooked, but that Jesus Christ makes full expiation for our sins."
" The causality is worked out on the cross; atonement is made for our sins, and "
"we are free from the guilt and the burden of sin. Where men deny the causality "

"ast-oppressed and haunted. We can say with David, “I will both lay me down in p"
"eace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety” (Ps. 4:8). We "
"have the blessedness of restful, trusting, sleep. Instead of a burden, the past"
