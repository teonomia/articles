msgid "In a study book published by the National Council of Churches in 1965, Colin W."
" Williams declared that, while warnings against the “new morality” were importa"
"nt, all the same “it seems equally clear that the ‘new morality’ does point to "
"new conditions which are forcing upon us a radical reconsideration of time-hono"
"red attitudes.” One of the things up for “radical reconsideration” is the famil"
"y. “The family is no longer as it is pictured in the New Testament … [T]he New "
"Testament family is the primary institution of society, and to it the church ha"
"s its primary relation.” But this kind of family, and its importance, is gone i"
"n our modern world, forever gone."

"	A Harvard sociologist, Carle C. Zimmerman claims otherwise: “The family s"
"till has its same functions, only in a different world … Family life means more"
" now than it ever did and we need it more.” Farming is still farming, Zimmerman"
" says, even though the farmer now uses a tractor and a truck instead of a team "
"of mules; similarly, the family is still the family, and more important than ev"
"er, even though some of its ways have changed. In the basic things, the family "
"is unchanged: the duties of parents, of husband and wife, and the obligations o"
"f children remain the same. “[T]hose who wish the fundamental family can get it"
", protect it and have it,” and most do. Moreover, the family is the primary ins"
"titution of society. The fact that the intellectuals neglect it does not make i"
"t any less important. The sun will not lose its importance in our lives if univ"
"ersity professors neglect it, and neither will the family perish because of the"
"ir neglect."

"	The family, Zimmerman points out, not only fulfills its basic functions, "
"but it has functions we seldom consider. It is, for example, any country’s best"
" police force: it protects its children by training and supervision from crimin"
"als and perverts, and it polices and disciplines millions of youngsters daily. "
"Also, Zimmerman points out, “The family is still the best educator.” Moreover, "
"“the family is still and will remain our great protective institution, from the"
" cradle to the grave.” The more difficult the world gets, the more responsibili"
"ties the family assumes to protect itself in a trying world; “the family has no"
"t lost functions but, rather, has gained them.”"

"Eden, and it is the only institution whose origin is in paradise, and when ente"
