"	God’s repeated test of the integrity of a people’s faith is their care fo"
"r widows, orphans, and strangers, for those who are outside their normal realm "
"of association. This is the second aspect of this commandment. To love our neig"
"hbor as ourselves is to show as great a concern for their welfare, rights, and "
"reputation as for our own. To love our neighbor as ourselves means to respect o"
"ur neighbor’s marriage and its sanctity (“Thou shalt not commit adultery”); his"
" life (“Thou shalt not kill”); his property (“Thou shalt not steal”); his reput"
"ation (“Thou shalt not bear false witness”); and to do this in word, thought, a"
"nd deed (“Thou shalt not covet...”).\n"
"	What this means is very clear. Beyond"
" a very limited sphere, judgment is the province of God. A godless state will a"
"ssume more and more of the prerogatives of God and assume powers of judgment ov"
"er all of life. Because we are not God, for us the decisive power in society mu"
"st be the regenerating power of God and the work of the Holy Spirit in and thro"
"ugh us. Not revolution but regeneration, not coercion but conversion, is our wa"
"y of changing the world and furthering the Kingdom of God. This is the heart of"
" Christian reconstruction. The heart of Biblical law is that it makes us the ba"
"sic government of society in and through our personal and family life, through "
"our vocations, churches, and schools. In Biblical law, civil government is a ve"
"ry limited and minor sphere of rule and power.\n"
"	No society can be healthy i"
"f the people are not strong in their faith. A strong state means a weak people."
" The various civil governments of the world are all strong and over-bearing in "
"their power because the peoples are weak in the faith. Statist power grows to f"
"ill a vacuum in government created by the irresponsibility of the people. When "
"men say of their Lord, “We will not have this man to reign over us” (Luke 19:14"
"), they are inviting anarchy. The Book of Judges describes such a time. Men had"
" rejected God as their king, and, because “In those days there was no king in I"
"srael” God having been denied, “every man did that which was right in his own e"
"yes” (Judges 21:25).\n"
"	When men do that which is right in their own eyes, wh"
"en they deny Christ our King and His law-word, then their word and their group "
"becomes the source of determination for them. Men then act humanistically and a"
"re determined by their group, not the Lord. Our governing allegiance must be to"
" Jesus Christ and His reign, not to our Catholic or Protestant churches.\n"
"	O"
"ur faith can rarely surpass our allegiance. If our allegiance is Presbyterian, "
"Baptist, Catholic, Methodist, or what have you, we are small men indeed, and ou"
"r “faith” a warped one at best. Churches like persons must be instruments in th"
"e hand of God, not the centers of our lives. We can and must respect the instru"
"ments, but we warp the faith if we are not God-centered."

msgid "R. J. RushdoonyRev. R.J. Rushdoony (1916–2001), was a leading theologian, churc"
"h/state expert, and author of numerous works on the application of Biblical law"
" to society. He started the Chalcedon Foundation in 1965. His Institutes of Bib"
