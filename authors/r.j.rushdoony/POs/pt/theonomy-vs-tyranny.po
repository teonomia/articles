msgid "Theonomy vs. TyrannyBy R. J. RushdoonyDecember 01, 2009"

msgid "Man’s choice is between theonomy and autonomy, God's law versus self-law. Man, "
"being a sinner, a fallen creature, can only create laws and societies which, in"
" their developed form, simply amplify man’s sin. The result is tyranny, rule wi"
"thout God."

msgid "The power to make laws is the mark of lordship, sovereignty, or explicit or imp"
"licit divinity. According to William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, “Unlimited power is"
" apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it, and this I know, my lords, t"
"hat where law ends, Tyranny begins.” Edmund Burke, a year later, 1771, said, “T"
"he greater the power, the more dangerous the abuse.” Both men made their commen"
"ts in response to the John Wilkes affair. Wilkes represented the unfettered wil"
"l of the people as against a still lingering belief in a higher law."

msgid "The word tyranny comes from the Latin tyrrannus; it means normally rule by an o"
"ppressive power, but, very commonly, tyrannies have been popular. Thus, Adolf H"
"itler was clearly a man with a popular following, as was Mussolini, and others "
"as well. A tyranny can be a popularly elected party, or group of men, so that a"
" tyranny can exist without a single tyrant. The essence of the tyranny is that "
"no absolute and God-ordained law and justice prevails, only the will of a man, "
"a group or party of men, or a majority or a minority of men. The essence of tyr"
"anny is that it represents in some form the will of man, not the law of God. On"
" the other hand, theonomy means literally the law of God. In our time, theonomy"
" represents to all too many people the essence of evil, for the will of man is "
"held to be the source of determination, of law, and morality."

msgid "As various areas of society, and its peoples, enthrone autonomy, they dethrone "
"theonomy, and they replace God with man. Thus, in one church after another, to "
"all practical intent God’s law has been replaced by man’s, and the rules and ca"
"nons of the church tend to prevail over God’s law. In issues relating to sexual"
"ity, homosexuality, abortion, and euthanasia, this has been especially the case"
". Tyranny in the church as in the state is tied to this substitution of man’s l"
"aw for God’s law."

msgid "The tyrants are earnest men, from the days of the Tower of Babel to the present"
". They believe that they are alone capable of saving the world by means of thei"
"r planned world order. Implicit in their stand is the belief that the Bible is "
"wrong, and Jesus Christ was wrong. As an instructor training car salesman in po"
