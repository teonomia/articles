"	Eschatology is defined by the dictionary as the branch of theology which "
"“treats of death, resurrection, immortality, the end of the world, final judgme"
"nt, and the future state.” The root of the word is eschatos, last. This definit"
"ion is accurate yet limited. Eschatology is much more than a concern about the "
"end, or the last times. Eschatology sets forth the goal of man and history and "
"is thus inseparable from purpose."

"	Eschatology is thus a very intensely practical concern. Questions such as"
", Why am I here?; What is the meaning and purpose of life?; What should we do, "

msgid "The eschatology of fallen man is humanistic, man-created and man-centered. It s"

"gies end in despair. Having no doctrine of theistic creation, man for them begi"
"ns and ends in the void. Again, having no doctrine of providence, their brighte"
"st eschatological hopes operate against the frustration of brute and meaningles"
"s factuality. Often, on borrowed, Biblical premises, humanistic eschatologies w"
"ill flourish briefly. Thus, the belief in progress was a secularized version of"
" the doctrine of providence, and it flourished for a time on that borrowed capi"
"tal. In time, of course, it was apparent that any belief in progress, without t"
"he presupposition of the God of Scripture, is rootless and futile, and the fait"
"h has waned accordingly."

"nstruments, designed by fallen man to usher in the humanistic millennium. These"
" are neither the first nor the last of such instruments. Certainly, the sexual "

"	Creation has a purpose, and that purpose is God-ordained and is written i"
"nto the being of all creation, so that all of creation, organic and inorganic, "
"moves in terms of that purpose. Paul, in Romans 8:19-23, makes this clear. Any "
"deflection from that eschatological goal, from that purpose, is death. Sin, as "
"the deflection of man from God’s eschatology to a man-made one, is thus clearly"
" death. Creation is thus inseparable from eschatology."

"	The same is true of providence. All of God’s providence moves in terms of"
" His glorious and eternal purpose. Thus, the declarations of eschatology cannot"
" be separated from the affirmations of providential care which Scripture sets f"
"orth. For example, in Psalm 34:7, we read, “The angel of the LORD encampeth rou"
"nd about them that fear him, and delivereth them,” and in Psalm 91 we have a mo"
"ving account of God’s providential care of His Son, Jesus Christ, and of us in "
"Him: “for he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy wa"
"ys” (Ps. 91:11). The Lord’s care of His covenant people is not for their sakes,"
" but for His covenant’s sake, and for His eternal purposes. It is eschatologica"
"l. There is no other cause in the universe which is ultimate and determinative "
"than the triune God and His eternal decree. The goals of providence are not man"
"-centered. Rather, it is man himself, willingly or otherwise, who is God-center"
"ed. Man’s being is thus governed by God’s eschatology."
