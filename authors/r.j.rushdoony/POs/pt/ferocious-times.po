"nd what is usually meant is the era from Christ’s first coming to His return. T"
"hese are the last times, says Peter (1 Pet. 1:20) and also John (1 John 2:18), "
"for example. This helps us to understand what Paul means in 1 Timothy 4:1, “Now"
" the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from"
" the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” This is "
"to explain to Timothy why two notable leaders, Hymenaeus and Alexander, had lef"
"t the faith (1 Tim. 1:20, 4:1). With the coming of Christ, the battle between g"
"ood and evil has intensified, and men are now “[w]ithout natural affection, tru"
"cebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are go"
"od,” and given to every evil (2 Tim. 3:3), and in these “last days perilous tim"
"es shall come” (2 Tim. 3:1)."
