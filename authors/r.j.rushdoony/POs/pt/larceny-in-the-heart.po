"urse, is inflation. Inflation is an increase in the money supply by the increas"

msgid "Helmut Schoek, in Envy (1966), called attention to the deadly role played in so"
"ciety by envy. Envy demands the leveling of all things, because the envious man"
" finds superiority in others intolerable. He sees it better to turn the world i"
"nto hell rather than to allow anyone to prosper more than himself, or to be sup"
"erior to him. Envy negates progress. On the other hand, as Schoek noted, "the m"
"ore both private individuals and the custodians of political power in a given s"
"ociety are able to act as though there were no such thing as envy, the greater "
"will be the rate of economic growth and the number of innovations in general."1"
" The envious man wishes to level and equalize, and he turns envy into ‘virtue' "
"by calling it a demand for fraternity and equality. Since, however, a strictly "
"equalitarian society is impossible, it follows, Schoek pointed out, that "the e"
"nvious man is, by definition, the negation of the basis of any society."2 Envy "
"creates a conflict society in which the evil men are held to be precisely the m"
"ost successful and advanced members of society. Their crime is their success, t"
"heir wealth, or their superiority. Envy is justified by many sociologists and s"
"ocial scientists, and envy becomes then a fertile and justified cause of vandal"
"ism, rioting, and crime. Hatred and resentment are justified and made marks of "
"a "social conscience." The result is class warfare and a conflict society in wh"
"ich the rise of hostility and envy are seen as steps towards social progress, w"
"hen in fact they lead to disaster."

"il" (Gen. 3:5). Every man has a right to be his own god, he held, determining f"

"must be abolished and equality instituted. Why should Adam and Eve labor like p"
