"ng their children in a Christian School which refused to submit to state contro"
"ls. Some of the fathers were prominent citizens of that county. The charges aga"

"	At two points, this step meant a radical break with Biblical law. First, "
"according to Scripture, husband and wife are "one flesh," a community of life, "
"and members one of another (Gen. 2:24, Matt. 19:5-6; Eph. 5:22-33). As a result"
", the one cannot testify against the other; spousal testimony for the prosecuti"
"on is thus barred. Second, the testimony must come from two or more witnesses ("
"Deut. 17:6; Heb. 10:28; Num. 35:30; Deut. 19:15; 2 Cor. 13:1; I Tim. 5:19; John"
" 8:17). Confession in itself is not enough 1o convict; there has to be corrobor"
"ating evidence, as in Achan's case (Josh. 9:20-23). As a result, enforced confe"
"ssion is rendered meaningless, because corroboration and witnesses are required"

"iage creates a new unit: the twain become one flesh. As such, they have powers "
"and responsibilities possessed by no other element of society. The family is th"
"e matrix of the future, and as a result God entrusts the control of the future "
"to the family, not to the church, nor to the state. Both church and state have "
"a duty to protect the family, not to control it. Biblical law, by giving contro"
