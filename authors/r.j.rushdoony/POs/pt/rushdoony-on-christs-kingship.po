msgid "In contemporary church and state trials, the language of state theology is ... "
"far-reaching in its claims. In no trial of churches, Christian schools, home sc"
"hools, or parents in which I have been involved has there been any question as "
"to the superior educational achievements and training of youth on the part of C"
"hristians. This, however, is considered usually an irrelevant issue because the"
" main concern of the state is to maintain its claims to sovereign jurisdiction."
" The issue is thus a religious one: who is the Lord, Christ or Caesar? Who is t"
"he Sovereign? We are plainly told by Scripture, not that Jesus will be King and"
" Lord, but that Jesus Christ “IS the blessed and ONLY Potentate, the King of ki"
"ngs, and Lord of lords” (1 Tim. 6:15). Because He is the King here and now and "
"forever more, His law-word must govern us now and always, and all things must b"
"e reordered and remade to conform to His royal word. No sphere of life is exemp"
"t from His government, and not an atom of creation was created apart from Him o"
"r has any right to independence from Him. Christ is not lord over merely a corn"
"er of creation, nor only the church, but over all things. He is not less than G"
"od but very God of very God as well as very man of very man. There can be no ju"
"stice or righteousness in man nor in society apart from Jesus Christ as Savior "
"and King."
