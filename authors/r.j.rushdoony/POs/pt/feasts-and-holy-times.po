"s commanded by God of the covenant people. However, first, it must be noted tha"
"t while failure to observe the Passover requires the excommunication of the man"
" who has no valid excuse for his failure (Num. 9:13), we have on the whole an a"
"ttitude of forbearance. Second, the religious days in the calendar are seen as "
"feasts and as privileged participations, not as penalties. The man who observes"
" God's feasts and holy days is neither restricted nor penalized thereby but pri"
"vileged and blessed. The perspective thus is not of a penalizing inclusion but "
"a privileged participation. This is far from the attitude of one mother I once "
