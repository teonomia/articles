"	One of the chronic problems of men is that too often they react instead o"
"f acting. The terms and nature of the problems of life are set by their opposit"
"ion rather than by themselves, and the reactions are foolish. This has all too "
"often been true of the reactions of men, Christian and non-Christian, to the wo"
"men’s liberation movement. The results are sometimes painful. Two examples will"
" suffice. In one church, some of the women came together to study Scripture. Th"
"e women were of varying ages but with a common need to know the Bible better in"
" its application to their everyday problems. The church ordered the meetings en"
"ded, although no problem had arisen. The concerns of the study were not ecclesi"
"astical, and the meetings were not a part of the church’s work nor limited to c"
"hurch members. By no stretch of the imagination can any text of Scripture be ma"
"de to forbid women to study Scripture together."

"	In at least several other churches, the women are held in an unbiblical s"
"ubjection which treats them as children, not adults. The Bible declares Sarah t"
"o be the model wife in her obedience and subjection (I Peter 3:1-7). We cannot "
"understand the meaning of that without recognizing the fact that, on occasion, "
"Sarah, confident in the godliness of her position, gave Abraham an ultimatum (G"
"en. 16:5; 21:9-13), and God declared, “in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, h"
"earken unto her voice” (Gen. 9:12), a sentence men rarely if ever use as a serm"

"	Moreover, as Charles Hodge said, with respect to Ephesians 5:22, the auth"
"ority of the husband (or any human authority) is not unlimited. “It extends ove"
"r all departments, but is limited in all; first, by the nature of the relation;"
" and secondly, by the higher authority of God. No superior, whether master, par"
"ent, husband or magistrate, can make it obligatory on us either to do what God "
"forbids, or not to do what God commands” (Charles Hodge: Commentary on the Epis"
"tle to the Ephesians, p. 31.4f). But this is not all. The stupidity of all too "
"many men is nowhere more apparent than in the assumption that subordination mea"
"ns inferiority. Most of us have at some time or other, and, usually, most of th"
"e time, been subordinate to very inferior men. In a fallen world, this is routi"
"ne. The world commonly appraises a man’s position in terms of very limited crit"
"eria, such as wealth, birth, education, and the like. The natural aristocracy o"
"f talent and character usually does not prevail in a sinful society! To assume "
"that pre-eminence in position and power is pre-eminence in intelligence,charact"
"er, and ability is to assume that the men who rule in Washington, D.C., and in "
"the Kremlin, are the cream of history! Such a perspective would be sheer idiocy"
", but it is a kind of idiocy all too many men have in relationship to women."

"	One aspect of this idiocy, proudly taught as gospel by some such churches"
" and pastors is the blasphemous assumption that the husband is the mediator bet"
"ween God and the wife. Scripture tells us that the husband is the head of the f"
"amily, not a mediator, nor a little Christ. In relationship to the Lord, husban"
"d and wife are declared to be “heirs together of the grace of life” (I Peter 3:"
"7); the husband is not declared to be the central heir, nor the recipient of gr"
"eater grace or wisdom. We are not told that the wife's prayers are hindered or "
"void if she fails to pray through a mediator-husband. Too many men want a lovel"
"y and charming wife to serve them and then to be a silent zombie the rest of th"
"e time! Peter tells us that the prayers of a husband and a wife are hindered if"
" either is false with respect to their duties under God."

"	When God ordained marriage, He also gave us a sentence to set forth its m"
"eaning: “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleav"
"e unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh” (Gen. 2:24). This is the opposite"
" of what too many see in marriage: the woman is viewed as leaving her parents a"
"nd cleaving, or adhering to, her husband. That she does so is true enough, but "
"the Bible stresses the requirement that the man make a break and cleave to his "
"wife. Moreover, Jesus Christ declares that this is God’s own statement (Matt. 1"
"9:5). Why then are commentaries and preachers silent about its meaning? It is c"
"lear that headship is given to the husband. Is it not here equally clear that a"
" particular and very great centrality is given to the woman, who is “the mother"
" of all living” (Gen. 3:20)?"

"	Man is made of the bones and flesh of his father and mother, as C. A. Sim"
"pson has pointed out in The Interpreter’s Bible, to become, in the act of marri"
"age, one flesh, one community of life, with his wife. In the Hebrew, the word “"
"cleave” means to cling close together, to be joined together, stick, or follow "
"closely after. Given this meaning, it is most significant that it is the man wh"
"om God in particular requires this of. Since headship is given to the man, the "
"human expectation would be that woman must adhere to the man and cling to him. "
"God, however, places another requirement on marriage: the man must be joined to"
", cling to, or cleave unto his wife."

"	Man, it should be noted. is given dominion over the earth, over the fish,"
" birds, and animals, and he shares the exercise of that dominion with his wife "
"(Gen. l:26-28). Man’s headship is in the exercise of that dominion. When Sarah "
"called Abraham “lord” (I Peter 3:1-7), it was because Abraham was the head in t"

"	It would be dangerous and false to push the point too far, or to see it a"
"s more than an important Biblical analogy, but the analogy to circumcision is t"
"here. In circumcision, the organ of generation is made the covenant mark by its"
" circumcised status, signifying that man’s hope is not in generation but in reg"

"Theology (1948), pointed out, “stands for justification and regeneration, plus "

"	In some sense, marriage is also comparable to a new life. The twain becom"
"e “one flesh,” a new community of life. In terms of this unity, Paul uses marri"
"age as a type of the unity of Christ and His church (Eph. 5:21-33). By this ana"
"logy. we are told that husbands must love their wives as Christ also loved the "
"church, “and gave himself for it.” This, plainly, calls for sacrificial service"
" to the new entity or life, the family. The headship of the husband is one of a"
" comparable radical love and sacrificial service, not a tyrannical power. Heads"
"hip in Scripture means, our Lord makes clear, service: “He that is greatest amo"
"ng you shall be your servant” (Matt. 23:1l). In the foot-washing episode, our L"
"ord says, “I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you"
"” (John 13:15). For men to seek the blessings of Christian marriage with pagan "
"doctrines of headship is blasphemous."

"ed attention to the fact that, in the old days, a bride went from her father’s "
"house to a new house with a unity of faith and heritage. “She was not exposed t"
"o any other man’s doctrine or ideals or values.” This is now completely changed"
" by public or statist education. The state imposes many fathers on a family’s s"
"ons and daughters; these teach creeds and values antagonistic to those of the p"
"upils’ families. The result said Rosenstock-Huessy, is a polytheistic education"
