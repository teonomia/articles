msgid "One of the unhappy facts of our day is the gap between evangelical Christianity"
" and political action. We have, on the one hand, those whose religion is politi"
"cs; they expect more than justice from the political order: they expect salvati"
"on. A political cause becomes their religion. On the other hand, we have those "
"who say that, because Christ is their Savior, they are not interested in the “d"
"irty business” of politics. Both attitudes are clearly wrong and dangerous as w"
"ell. For the Christian to separate himself from political action is to separate"
" himself from responsibility, and to separate himself from responsibility is to"
