"	Very plainly, our Lord requires us to give priority to the Kingdom of God"
". This means, first, that this Kingdom must govern us, our institutions (includ"
"ing church and state), our vocations, activities, arts, sciences, families, our"
"selves, and all things else. There is no sphere, area, nor even an atom in all "
"creation outside this Kingdom and its absolute government."

"vereign, Christ the King. He is “the blessed and only Potentate, the King of ki"
"ngs, and Lord of lords” (1 Tim. 6:15). The realm of the triune God cannot be gi"
"ven to another without sin, and if we yield either ourselves, our families, or "
"our nations to another sovereign, we shall be judged."

"ce, because Christ’s way is not revolution but regeneration. The revolutionary "
"act for us must be faithfulness to every word that proceeds from the mouth of G"
"od (Matt. 4:4). Opposition does little good without Christian reconstruction in"
" terms of God’s law-word. Tax protesters fail to recognize that what God requir"

"lure to take God’s sovereignty seriously is their failure to regard God’s judgm"

"promise life and blessings for obedience, and curses and death for disobedience"

" man, it can only be exercised in terms of God’s law. Any departure from that l"
