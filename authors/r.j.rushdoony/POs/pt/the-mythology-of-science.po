msgid "On the surface, a myth is the illusion of an age or a culture whereby life and "
"its origins are interpreted. As such, the myth has an axiomatic truth to the ag"

msgid "But much more is involved in the concept of myth. A myth is the attempt of a cu"
"lture to overcome history, to negate the forces and ravages of time, and to mak"
"e the universe amenable and subject to man. The myth reveals a hatred of histor"
"y. History shows movement in terms of forces beyond man and in judgment over ma"
"n; history rides heavily over man, is inescapably ethical, shows a continuing c"
"onflict between good and evil, and clearly reveals man as the actor, not the pl"
"aywright and director. And this man hates. To fill a role he never wrote, to en"
"ter on stage at a time not of his choosing, this man resents. The purpose man t"
"hen sets for himself in his myths is to end history, to make man the absolute g"
"overnor by decreeing an end to the movement that is history. Where his myths ac"
"knowledge man's lot in history, man ascribes his sorry role, not to his depravi"
"ty, but to jealousy of the gods. The goal of the myth, ever more clearly enunci"
"ated over time, has become the destruction of history and the enthronement of m"
"an as the new governor of the universe."

msgid "The means used by man to accomplish the goal of his myth is magic. The purpose "
"of magic is the total control by man over man, nature, and the supernatural. Wh"
"atever the form magic takes, this is its goal. The relationship of magic is the"
"refore basically to science rather than to Biblical religion. Under the influen"
"ce of Christianity, science escaped the constraints of magic. The purpose of sc"
"ience gradually ceased to be an attempt to play god and became rather the exerc"
"ise of dominion over the earth under God. The redeemed Christian is God's viceg"
"erent over the earth, and science is one of man's tools in establishing and fur"
"thering that dominion. For science to overstep that role is to forsake science "
"for magic. The purposes of modern science are increasingly those of magic, the "
"exercise of total control. The essential goal of modern science is knowledge in"
" order to have prediction, planning, and control. Thus magic has again triumphe"
"d, and modern science is popular precisely because man today, wedded again to t"
"he world of myth, demands magic to overcome history, to eliminate the ethical s"
"truggle and to place man beyond good and evil and beyond judgment. On the whole"
", modern science has taken readily to this new role, and it is enjoying its sta"
"tus as magician in the mind of modern man. Science has become magic and is gove"
"rned by myth."
