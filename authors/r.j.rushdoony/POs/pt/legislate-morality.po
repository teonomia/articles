msgid "The other night, a prominent lawyer, appearing on television, asked for the rep"
"eal of laws against abortion, narcotics, sexual perversions, and a number of ot"
"her things. "You can't legislate morality," he said, "and it's about time we st"
"opped trying to do it." The man was lying, and he knew it, because all law is a"

"ou are legislating morality. When you institute traffic laws, you are again leg"
"islating morality: you are penalizing traffic behavior which may endanger the l"
"ife and property of another man. In other words, you are enacting specific form"
"s of God's law: Thou shalt not kill, and Thou shalt not steal. Legislation abou"
"t the forms of court procedure is in terms of the law banning false witness; th"
"e purpose of such laws is to further true testimony. Even the salaries of publi"
"c officials have moral implication: "[T]he labourer is worthy of his hire" (Luk"
"e 10:7; 1 Tim. 5:18)."

msgid "At every point, the law deals either with morality directly or with procedures "
"for its enforcement. All law is enacted morality. Every criminal law says that "
"a certain thing is right, and another wrong. Every law is thus a piece of legis"
"lated morality. Moreover, all morality represents a religion, as that every sys"
"tem of law is an establishment of religion. Thus, there can be a separation of "
"church and state, but there cannot be a separation of religion and the state, b"
"ecause every system of law is a religion and a morality in action."
