msgid "For Karl Marx, the two great enemies were the Biblical God and the family. He s"
"aw these two enemies linked together as the great champions of private property"
". Private ownership of property was for Marx and Engels the cornerstone of the "
"family, and the family the key institution of Biblical religion. To abolish pri"
"vate ownership of property, Christianity had to be attacked."

msgid "Marx and Engels were right in that they knew who their real enemies were. The B"
"ible protects property in two of the Ten Commandments: “Thou shalt not steal” a"
"nd “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house … nor any thing that is thy neig"
"hbour’s.” But this is not all. The Mosaic law had no property tax: a man, rich "
"or poor, was made secure in his house and land from dispossession or seizure, a"
"nd the Levitical laws emphasized this heavily. Man’s basic security the Biblica"
"l law saw as resting in the private possession of property without the possibil"
"ity of confiscation. The American colonies deliberately followed the Biblical l"
"aw and avoided any property tax in any form. In some states, there was no prope"
"rty tax until after the Civil War. Recently, Nebraska abolished both the state "
"property tax and the state income tax. The Liberty Bell carries a verse from th"
"e Bible’s law of property: “proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all t"
"he inhabitants thereof” (Lev. 25:10)."

msgid "Wherever private property disappears, man’s liberty is gone. Man is placed comp"
"letely at the mercy of the state. Wherever private ownership is weakened, man’s"
" liberty is weakened also. There is an essential relationship between liberty a"
"nd property. The American colonists saw this. One of the slogans of the War of "
"Independence was “Liberty and Property.” Every attack on the private ownership "
"of property is therefore an attack on liberty. It is an attempt to destroy the "
"independence of man from the state, from the tyranny of civil governments. It i"
"s especially important for tyrants to destroy private ownership of farming prop"
"erty, either by direct confiscation or by indirection, by controls. In every ag"
"e, one of the primary targets of dictatorship has been to control the farmer."

msgid "The attack on private ownership is also an attack on God because it despises Hi"
"s law and substitutes for it man’s humanistic and socialistic law. The defense "
"of private ownership is both a healthy and a necessary religious step. It is th"
"e defense of a way of life ordered by God for the welfare and happiness of mank"
"ind. The right to property is a God-given right. Ownership is evidence of work "
"and character. Every attempt to limit the right of ownership is a form of theft"
", and the Bible says clearly: “Thou shalt not steal.”"
