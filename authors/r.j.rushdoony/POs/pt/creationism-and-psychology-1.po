msgid "Humanistic psychology gives us a doctrine of man radically at odds with Scriptu"
"re. It has become routine for clergymen to look to humanistic psychologies for "
"guidance in pastoral counselling, and books applying such psychologies to pasto"
"ral problems have had a ready market and a widespread influence. The result has"
" been the steady infiltration of humanism into Christian circles and the steady"
" erosion of the Biblical doctrines of man and of salvation."

msgid "In analyzing the Biblical doctrine of man and the psychology of man, it is nece"
"ssary, first, to recognize that man is declared to be a creature, created by th"
"e sovereign act of God on the sixth day of creation (Genesis 1: 26-31). This fa"
"ct gives us a radically different picture of man than that provided by evolutio"
"n. Instead of emerging out of chaos and an animal ancestry, man is the direct a"

msgid "This means, second, that man has a short history, not a long and unknown past. "
"Third, by virtue of the fact of creation according to a pattern, the eternal pu"

msgid "Humanistic psychology looks backward to a primitive past in order to explain ma"
"n, whereas Biblical psychology looks neither to the child nor a primitive past "
"to explain man but to a mature creation, Adam, and to God's purpose in man's cr"
"eation. If man in his origin is a product of a long evolutionary past, man is t"
"hen best understood in terms of the animal, the savage, and the child. However,"
" since man was in his origin a mature creation, his psychology is best understo"
"od in terms of that fact. Man's sins and shortcomings represent not a lingering"
" primitivism or a reversion to childhood but rather a deliberate revolt against"
" maturity and the requirements of maturity."

msgid "Sixth, man was created in the image of God. Man was created good because he was"

msgid "Seventh, God having created man in His image, ordered man to exercise dominion "
"and to subdue the earth. This is man's basic calling and a basic aspect of the "
"nature of man. Thus, not only is man's nature created by God, but man's calling"

msgid "Eleventh, man was created to live in a perfect world and to till it and to keep"
" it (Gen. 2: 15). Thus, man's psychology has basic to it a relationship to the "
"earth itself, which is reinforced by the fact that man was formed out of "the d"
"ust of the ground" (Gen. 2: 7) and then made into a living soul. Man is thus ea"
"rth-bound, physically and psychologically. The earth is the area of his dominio"
