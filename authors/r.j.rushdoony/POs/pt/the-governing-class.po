"	G. William Domhoff, associate professor of Psycholory of the University o"
"f California at Santa Cruz, has written a very interesting study of Who Rules A"
"merica? (Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. 1967) The book is e"
"xtensively researched; Domhoff goes to conservative sources, such as Dan Smoot,"
" as well as to very liberal writers. But he could not be more wrong in his conc"
"lusions. Domhoff finds that “the American upper class” controls the executive b"
"ranch of the U.S. government, controls foundations, education, the C.I.A, most "
"important corporations, mass media, and much more. There is a “governing class”"
" in America, he believes, and he lumps together such families as the Rockefelle"
"rs, the Pews, and the Lillys as a more or less working team in this “governing "
"class.”"

"	Let us examine this idea from the perspective of an old American belief, "
"in the natural aristocracy of talent. The founders of the United States believe"

"f ability and talent. Such an aristocracy always rises to the top: the best att"
"itude of a country should be to further its progress to the top rather than to "
"impede it. In other words, superiority asserts itself and governs. If the moral"
" character, if the faith of a people is defective, then the superiority which p"
"revails is of an evil sort, but, if the character be godly, then a godly superi"

" are the world’s true elite and that a handful of them can govern the vast mass"
"es of the world. Others hold that the real conspiracy is a German one, and ever"
"ything is viewed in terms of a new German threat; again, these people are decla"
"ring implicitly the superiority of Germans and their belief that only a world a"
"nti-German policy can save us from the German menace. Still others see the thre"
"at as an English one, involving the Rhodes funds and much more; again, this is "

"	But there are conspiracies, and they are a threat, some will protest, and"

"rry, disorganized bumbler, Marxism was simply wild, confused hatred. But superi"

"nd superiority. Take Lenin: vicious, depraved, ruthless, all that and more, but"
" also very intelligent, clearly superior. His writings are still amazing readin"
"g, and they explain why, in an evil age, he could ride that tide to power. For "
"example, he saw clearly that any abandonment of gold as money, and the adoption"
" of a central banking system, was nine-tenths of socialism, so that the logic o"
"f economics would drive a world going off gold and into central banking into co"
"mmunism in time. We are busy today proving Lenin was right here and elsewhere. "
"When Khrushchev said, “We will bury you” he had in mind the inevitability of th"
"e forces at work in the free world. Get rid of every communist in the United St"
"ates, sever relations with the Soviet Union, and defeat communists in Vietnam a"
"nd elsewhere, and the U.S. will still go communist because of its present monet"
"ary policy, one in operation for a generation and more. The worst “communism” i"
"n the U.S. is that which is written into our monetary policy, and there is no s"

"y sometimes regret the passing of a good line, but if it fell, it was either th"
"rough inability to rule, or, if they were still able, because the moral foundat"
"ions of their rule were destroyed. In old Russia, the schools and universities "
"created a generation of men whose moral foundations were anarchistic and anti-C"
"hristian: this new breed represented tremendous but evil ability, and the war e"

"oyed in a number of countries: the difference in the time of collapse was made "
