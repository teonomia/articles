"	The church was both influenced by that Greco-Roman culture and also hosti"
"le to it. Herbert B. Workman,in Persecution in the Early Church (1906), noted: "
"“By Roman theory the State was the one society which must engross every interes"
"t of its subjects, religious, social, political, humanitarian, with the one pos"
"sible exception of the family. There was no room in Roman law for the existence"
", much less the development on its own lines of organic growth, of any corporat"
"ion or society which did not recognize itself from the first as a mere departme"
"nt or auxiliary of the State. The State was all and in all, the one organism wi"
"th a life of its own. Such a theory the Church, as the living kingdom of Jesus,"
" could not possibly accept in either the first century or the twentieth.” Many "
"churchmen then as now tried to accommodate themselves to the sovereignty of the"
" State or emperor rather than Christ. They were willing to confess, “Caesar is "
"lord.” The church in part was preserved from absorption by Roman persecution. T"
"he intransigent, uncompromising Christians preserved the church by their refusa"

"	All the same, however, some things were absorbed, i.e., neoplatonism, Ari"
"stotelianism, Stoicism, asceticism, and the like. An important borrowing from R"

"nd diakoneo in Timothy. The word, in English as deacon, means a servant, servic"
"e; it refers to a function. In Romans l2:4, office in the Greek ispraxis, funct"
"ion. In Timothy 3:1, it is episkope and its meaning is supervision or inspectio"

"	Both Eastern and Western churches, and, in the West, Catholicism, Protest"

" could bring in hundreds and even thousands of people, lead to a great church c"
"omplex, attract people and money, and give the members the vicarious feeling of"
" being part of a great church. This still is very, very much with us. Some peop"
