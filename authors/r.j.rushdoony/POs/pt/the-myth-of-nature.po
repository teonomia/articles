msgid "The Myth of NatureBy R. J. RushdoonyOctober 18, 2011"
msgstr ""

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "One of the major myths of the modern world is the idea that there is some such "
"thing as "Nature," which the Second Edition of Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dic"
"tionary defines as "a creative, controlling agent, force, or principle, or set "
"of such forces or principles, operating or operative in a thing and determining"
" wholly or chiefly its constitution, development, well-being, or the like," or "
""That which is produced by natural forces; the universe; as, laws governing nat"
"ure; nothing happens without cause in nature; more narrowly, the totality of ph"
"ysical reality, exclusive of minds and the mental.""

msgid "It is one thing to say that the universe or creation exists; it is another to a"
"ssert that this universe is the source of its own laws and phenomena, or that i"
"t is a self-enclosed system of causality."

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "The Bible has no such term as "Nature." It does not recognize Nature as the sou"
"rce and cause of natural phenomena; rather, it sees God directly and absolutely"
" operative in all natural phenomena. There is no law inherent in "nature," but "
"there is a law over "nature." "Nature" is a collective name for an uncollectivi"
"zed reality, and by uncollectivized it is meant that "nature" has no unity in a"
"nd of itself that makes it a unified order. To assert that such a unity exists "
"in and as "Nature" is to assert a hierarchical principle concerning the univers"
"e and its spheres."

##HTML: <p >{{#c}}</p>
msgid "If "nature" is a unity in status or in process, then it represents a system of "
"higher and lower authorities, powers, and laws. It is subject to understanding "
"in terms of its past, present, or continuing development as a scale of being in"
" which there is both higher and lower being. The laws of that realm of being ar"
"e to be derived from within the scale of being. If the primitive and lower is h"
"eld to be more vital, then it is the true source of power and determination. If"
" the rational and higher is held to be more important, then it becomes the nece"
"ssary source of power and determination. In either case, causality and creative"
" power are inherently located within the universe, and it becomes necessary to "
"posit "Nature" as the ground of being, source of ultimacy, and "the system of a"
"ll phenomena in space and time." If God is the Creator, then the system is not "
""Nature," but God's eternal decree."

msgid "To rule out the traditional concept of "Nature" means also to alter the traditi"
"onal concept of the natural and the supernatural. In terms of the myth, the nat"
"ural represents the normal life of a self-contained world system, whereas the s"
"upernatural is the intrusion of God's activity into that system. But if natural"
" and supernatural events are both equally the activity of the triune God, and b"
"oth equally His direct activity, then the distinction must be made on other gro"
"unds. The Bible does not hesitate to ascribe to God the storms, lightning, thun"
"der, drought, plague, and other natural happenings in the same way that it ascr"
"ibes the Virgin Birth and other miracles to Him. The Bible makes a vast distinc"
"tion between the birth of men generally and the birth of Jesus Christ, but the "
"difference is not to be found in locating God in the miracle and ascribing natu"
"ral births to "nature." Rather, God is equally present in both; both are His di"
"rect decree, power, and action. The difference is not in the degree of God's pr"
"esence or activity, but in the nature of the acts. The natural births represent"
" God's pattern for mankind in its generation, whereas the Virgin Birth represen"
"ts God's pattern for mankind in its regeneration. The Virgin Birth is unique, b"
"ut it is still God's pattern or plan in terms of His eternal decree: mankind is"
" miraculously given a new creation in Jesus Christ, and all who are reborn in H"
"im are "born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of ma"
"n, but of God" (John 1:13)."

msgid "The introduction of the concept of "Nature" and natural law, derived from Helle"
"nic philosophy, led to a departure from Biblical faith. Natural law spoke of a "
"self-contained system of its own inherent law. One of its products was Deism, w"
"hich reduced God to the mechanic who merely created "Nature," and now "Nature" "
"functioned independently of God. The next step was to accept the ultimacy of "N"
"ature" and to drop God entirely."
