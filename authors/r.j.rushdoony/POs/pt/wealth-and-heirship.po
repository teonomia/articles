msgid "One of the most powerful, corrosive, and destructive forces in all of history i"
"s very much at work today in all the world: envy. Envy is, in terms of Biblical"
" faith, very clearly a sin, but, in the modern age, it comes disguised as a vir"
"tue. The motive force in much of the equalitarianism of our day is not a sense "
"of brotherhood but an envy which seeks to level all things. Envy also masks its"
"elf as a concern, very commonly, for social justice, and it lays claims to sain"
"tly character while promoting hatred, revolution and murder."

" new elitism and established a social order more static, fixed, and class-consc"

"and democracy, while in practice working to destroy all three of these things. "
"Envy capitalizes on issues, not on principles. The world being a sinful and fal"

msgid "Because envy is sin, it wars against virtue and character. While capitalizing o"
"n the weaknesses of, let us say, the middle class, the doctors, technicians, pr"

"cter and strength. It says in effect, let none be better than myself. (Some yea"
"rs ago, as a young man, I saw in a particular church an evil family champion a "
"pastor of bad character. In one incident, I learned that they liked him for his"
" sins, because it "justified" them, whereas every godly man was slandered and r"
"esented by them.) The unwritten law in the hearts of envious men is, Let no man"

" at length, but our concern now is with a key area for envy: wealth and heirshi"
"p. It is commonly said that we live in a very materialistic age; Pitrim Sorokin"
" called it also a sensate culture. The lust for wealth, or at least the appeara"

" In practice, taking money from the rich means giving it to an even richer stat"

"us stop briefly to stress an important distinction. There is a very great diffe"
"rence between unearned wealth and unjustly gained wealth. My father left me no "
"money, being a poor pastor, but he left me some books, (a very important form o"
"f wealth for me). I have a personal library of 25-30,000 books, many of which I"
" inherited from my father, and from two other pastors, (and many of which I bou"
"ght). I did not earn many of those books, (although many I did). Am I unjustly "
"the owner of the unearned books? They were given to me as acts of love and grac"
"e, and I am happily and gratefully their present possessor. My books are a form"
" of wealth for me, and they have been so also for friends and associates who ha"
"ve used them in their research. Only if I were to have some stolen books in my "
"library would these be an illegitimate form of wealth. The distinction between "
"legitimate and illegitimate wealth must not be obscured."
