msgid "One of the less popular verses of the Bible is Isaiah 24:2. Isaiah, in speaking"
" of the coming judgment on the Kingdom of Judah, declared: “And it shall be, as"
" with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; "
"as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; "
"as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with t"
"he giver of usury to him.” People in Isaiah’s day knew that something was wrong"
" with their world, but not with themselves; the people blamed the priests, and "
"the priests the people; the buyer blamed the seller, and the seller the buyer, "
"and so on. And they were all right; corruption extended to every area of societ"
"y. Therefore, God declared through Isaiah, judgment would affect them all equal"
"ly."

msgid "What about our situation today? On all sides we hear extensively a chorus of co"
"mplaints about everyone. Especially of late we have heard complaints about our "
"politicians, and the complaints are true. But it is possible to say, that, with"
" all their faults, our politicians may still be better than we deserve. Allan N"
"evins, in his study Grover Cleveland, wrote very wisely: “Character is not made"
" overnight. When it appears in transcendent degree, it is usually the product o"
"f generations of disciplined ancestry, or a stern environment, or both.” Let us"
" apply this to the situation today. If a people lack discipline and character, "
"will they elect to office, call to the pulpit, or call to the schools men of di"
"scipline and character? And if the homes and schools do not produce young men o"
"f Christian faith and stability, how can we then expect to find such character "
"in any area of life? “Like people, like priest” (Hosea 4:9)."
