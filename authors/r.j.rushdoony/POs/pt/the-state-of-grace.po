" time every noise meant a possible bombing or an enemy attack. His life was one"
" of continual tension and pressure, as well as responsibility. All of this beca"
"me a way of life and a normal condition, which he lived with in almost stoical "
"resistance. Then, after the war, he awoke one night from a frightening nightmar"
"e in which the enemy were attacking and his machine gun jammed. Shaking with fe"
"ar and horror, he turned on the light to help shake off the nightmare. “The war"
" is over,” he told himself. The words and the light pushed back the darkness an"

"objective fact is that the welfare or enmity between God and man is ended by th"
