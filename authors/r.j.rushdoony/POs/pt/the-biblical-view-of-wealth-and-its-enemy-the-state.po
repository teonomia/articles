msgid "A key aspect of idolatry is that an often otherwise legitimate aspect of this w"
"orld is made absolute. Very commonly, the state, which has a very limited but l"
"awful status under God is made into an idol and becomes, in Hegel's terms, God "
"walking on earth. This is idolatry. However, it is equally false to see the sta"
"te as absolute evil and the source of sin. It is the heart of man which is the "
"source of sin, and the state reflects our sins and our envious desires."

" God, and a means whereby we can bless others, or it can be a witness to our lu"
"st for power and a curse to others. Private wealth can capitalize a society, as"

"the Bible speaks of God's concern for the poor, and we are told that the poor m"
"an is our brother, but it would be absurd to conclude that poverty is seen as a"
" happy goal for man! Rather, we are told, if God's people are faithful to His l"
"aw, "there shall be no poor among you: for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in"
" the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it: "
"Only if thou carefully harken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to"
" do all these commandments which I command thee this day" (Deut. 15:4-5). God t"
"hus designates the abolition of poverty as the goal of His law-word. To avoid t"
"he force of Deut. 15:4-5, all too many will cite Matthew 26:11, "For ye have th"
"e poor always with you; but me ye have not always." All this means is that the "
"Lord told the disciples that, during their lifetime, they would always have opp"

" Through Congress, we enact envy into law, and now that envy reaches into our p"
"ockets, we are angry. This is not to say that the I.R.S. is without guilt, but "
"that the primary guilt rests with Congress and the people. The fact is that the"
