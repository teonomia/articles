msgid "Jesus declared, “I am the door of the sheep,” a figure of speech meaning that H"
"e alone is the way to salvation. “All that ever came before me are thieves and "
"robbers” (Jn. 10:7, 8). All other religious leaders (other than the Biblical wr"
"iters who spoke of Him and declared His Word) are enemies of man, “thieves and "
"robbers.” That included Confucius, Socrates, Buddha, Mohammed, and others, for,"
" as one Biblical scholar has stated, the expression is exclusive and takes in p"
"ast, present, and future. Jesus was emphatic: He alone is the truth: “I am the "
"way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (Jn. 14"
":6)."

msgid "The premise of our Lord’s statement is a clear-cut one: truth is exclusive; it "
"cannot include a lie. But no idea is more alien to our modern temper. We want a"
" foot in every camp; we want to eat our cake and have it too. We want God, but "
"with no offense to Satan."

msgid "But truth is exclusive; it is not tolerant. If two plus two equals four, it is "
"not true that it equals three or that it equals five, nor can we say that a chi"
"ld who answers three or five is “almost right.” The answer is either right or w"
"rong. We cannot say that a man is a persistent liar and at the same time call h"
"im honest and trustworthy. We cannot say that a man is a thief and at the same "
"time insist that he respects other people’s rights and properties."

"g. A child recently brought home an arithmetic problem which began, “If 8 is gr"
"eater than 15….” If 8 is greater than 15, then a lie can be greater than the tr"

msgid "There is, however, an unchanging hardness about truth. Jesus said, “I am … the "
"truth …; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.” Jesus expressed not a hope, "
"but a hard reality. There is no other way. Men either live by truth, or it kill"
"s them. If a businessman treats $8 as greater than $15, he is soon bankrupt. A "
"nation that coddles its criminals and penalizes its godly citizens must either "
"change or perish. Our Lord said, “Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men ga"
"ther grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?” (Mt. 7:16)."
