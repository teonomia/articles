msgid "When God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses, He instituted thereby the laws to "
"govern man’s relationship to God and to his fellow men. The first four commandm"
"ents govern worship. The other six govern the family, property, man’s speech an"
"d testimony (“Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour”), and th"
"e heart of man (“Thou shalt not covet”). With the triumph of Christianity in th"
"e Western world, these laws became basic to all society, and the result was Chr"
"istian civilization."

msgid "In 1847, however, another set of ten commandments for man and society were proc"
"laimed by Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto. It was a program stated d"
"eliberately in ten points in order to provide the “new law” for mankind, to rep"
"lace the Bible and its Ten Commandments. Marx’s new “ten commandments” called f"
"or (1) abolition of private property in land; (2) the income tax; (3) abolition"
" of all right of inheritance; (4) confiscation of all property of rebels and em"
"igrants; (5) a national bank monopoly and concentration and centralization of c"
"redit in its hands; (6) state control of communications and transport; (7) stat"
"e ownership of factories and instruments of production; (8) equal liability of "
"all to labor and establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture"
"; (9) combination of agriculture with industry and the abolition of the distinc"
"tion between town and country; (10) free education, plus child labor as a part "
"of education. The result, Marx believed, would be a wonderful and happy world."

msgid "Two law systems are at war today, two sets of Ten Commandments. One offers man "
"the good life through faith, godly morality, and law. The other offers the good"
" life through changing the environment, that is, by revolutionary action. For t"
"he Christian, the environment can only truly be changed as men are changed, and"
" these men then remake their world and place it under God’s law. For the Marxis"
"t, men are changed by changing the environment because man is only a reflex of "
"his environment, not a lord over it. Between these two positions there can be n"
"o peace nor any coexistence."
