"self a Zoroastrian. This dualistic faith has long been an undercurrent, taking "
"many forms, in Europe and elsewhere. Its fundamental belief is that two equal g"
"ods or life-forces exist, the one calling itself good, and the other bad. Both "
"are equal powers or forces; both have equal validity. If rape, incest, sodomy, "
"abortion, euthanasia, murder, and theft are your "thing" or taste, then your li"
"festyle has equal validity with the Christian way of life. In fact, because the"
