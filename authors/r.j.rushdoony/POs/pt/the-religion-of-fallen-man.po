msgid "Because man was created by God, man cannot escape God’s creating purpose. Even "
"in his rebellion and in all his revolutionary activity, man manifests God’s pur"
"poses, however much he may deform them. Man seeks to create a paradise, exercis"
"e dominion, increase his knowledge, and, in many more ways, to manifest those a"
"spects of God’s image in him which govern him in his culture and society. Among"
" these aspects of man’s culture which reveal God’s purpose is religion. Since m"
"an was created to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever, man cannot escape being"
" a religious creature. In the state of depravity, however, man seeks a religiou"
"s faith apart from God and in hostility to Him."

"ese mockers was a god who met their demands, who gave them all glory as their c"
"aptive power, or a bribed suzerain. While the psalmist pleads for deliverance, "

msgid "The fabricated gods are dead gods; “they cannot even make the faintest and most"
" inarticulate gutteral [sic] noise, like the lower animals; much less speak as "
"men do.”[2] The obvious fact about idols is that they are lifeless and meaningl"
"ess creatures, unable to do anything. The psalmist’s climactic point is that “T"
"hey that make them are like unto them; so is everyone that trusteth in them” (v"
". 8). According to Alexander, “How formidable now, they shall hereafter be as p"
"owerless and senseless as the gods they worship.”[3] Another point needs to be "
"added: not only is the future destiny of humanists this radical impotence, but "
"they are impotent even now in their seeming power. Because God is the Lord, all"
" their words add up only to a radical frustration and impotence."

" Such gloomy conclusions, derived from a less than benign view of human nature,"
" do not recommend themselves to the 20th century political imagination or to th"

"may dispute the truth and thereby redefine it? Have we lost our sense of respon"
"sibility toward one another and toward the community as a whole? Or have we all"
" gone crazy?” The root of the problem, Braden holds, is “the use of disorder, o"

msgid "Man being a sinner, when he substitutes a do-it-yourself religion and a man-mad"
"e morality for God’s Word, his substitute becomes sin made into a system. The r"
"evolutionary activities and movements of the 20th century, and of the modern er"
"a, have been intensely religious and thoroughly humanistic. Their net result ha"
"s been to make every man his own god and law. Not surprisingly, this has led to"
" totalitarian statism and what Braden calls “violently coercive” measures to av"
"oid anarchy."

msgid "But Braden will not see that his own principles produce the moral anarchy, the "
"disorder and the antilaw, which he deplores. To do so would require him to fors"
"ake his humanism, and this in principle he will not do. The problem with humani"
"sts is not a lack of intelligence but a willful self-blinding. In his religious"
" quest, the humanist refuses to look beyond himself for his god. The more he in"
"tensifies his quest, the more he becomes, like the idols described by the psalm"
"ist, speechless, mindless, and senseless. Not surprisingly, the heart of mystic"
"ism, a form of humanistic religion, is this same speechless, mindless, and sens"
"eless experience. The mystic calls for the exclusion of the external world, doc"
"trine, revelation, and outer experience for total concentration on an inward bl"

msgid "Because humanism ascribes the word of truth to man, it must of necessity ascrib"

"logically believes that his revealed truth, love, can also overcome war and hat"
"red and inaugurate world peace. Man’s world becomes the word of power because i"
"t is the word of truth. The capacity for self-reform is assumed to be great and"
" even limitless. In Boston’s phrase, it is implicit in such thinking that a man"
" can “leap out of Delilah’s lap, into Abraham’s bosom.”[6] But the sinner canno"
"t reform himself to please God, only to please himself. “The unrenewed will is "
"wholly perverse, in reference to man’s chief and highest end. The natural man’s"
" chief end is not God, but himself.”[7] For such men, God is “[t]he means, and "
