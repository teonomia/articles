msgid "Some people, shocked by these statements, have acted as though this were some s"

msgid "When the Bible commands that “Thou shalt not bear false witness” (Exod. 20:16; "
"Deut. 5:20), it means that the God of truth requires all men to live by His law"
" and in terms of His righteousness. The God of truth requires man, who is creat"
"ed in God’s image, to bear witness to the truth. To bear false witness is thus "
"not only to disobey God but to deny Him: it is practical atheism. The “right” t"
"o lie is then practical atheism, atheism in the rulers and atheism in the peopl"
"e. Christian faith is in the right of truth, and in its inevitable triumph."
