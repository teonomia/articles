msgid "History, therefore, is not the outworking of impersonal forces but a personal c"
"onflict between the forces of God and anti-God, Christ and antichrist, with the"
" ultimate victory assured to God and His Christ. The Bible as a whole presents "
"a view of history as conspiracy, with Satan and man determined to assert their "
""right" to be gods, knowing, or determining, good and evil for themselves (Gene"
"sis 3:5). From beginning to end, this is the perspective of Scripture, and only"
" a wilful misreading of it can lead to any other position."

msgid "In Psalm 2, this concept of history as conspiracy is briefly summarized. It sho"
"uld be noted that no other psalm is more frequently quoted in the New Testament"
"; Revelation is in a sense an expansion of the same vision. Psalm 2 was written"
" by David in terms of a personal and national event, and he saw the cosmic cris"
"is behind the local affair. The whole world is seen as organized against the Lo"
"rd and in deliberate opposition to His rule, for David sees, not himself, but t"
"he Lord Messiah as the true king. In verses 1-3, the worldly conference of the "
"conspiracy is depicted: "Why do the heathen (or nations) rage, and the people i"
"magine a vain thing?" The nations rage against their bondage to God, and they t"
"ake counsel or conspire against God and His Christ, planning to create their ow"
"n world order and law in contempt of Him. In w. 4-6, the heavenly confidence is"
" revealed, and the certainty of the outcome. God laughs, He holds the nations i"
"n derision, but He gives evil time to mature, so that the issue becomes clear-c"
"ut. His Son is already the ordained king of creation. In vv. 7-9, the Messiah d"
"eclares the divine decree in relation to Himself. His kingship is authorized as"
" the Son of God, v. 7; God endows Him with all the earth, v. 8; He is given the"
" power to overcome all His enemies, v. 9, and to destroy the conspiracy; to Him"
" the peoples and realms are promised as a gift for His victory and kingship. In"
" w. 10-12, the nations are exhorted to abandon the conspiracy against God and H"
"is Christ or else face destruction. They must either accept the scepter of Chri"
"st's authority and blessing or be broken with the rod of iron. To this view of "
"history, Jesus Christ gave His authority, declaring of the men of His day, as t"
"hey conspired against Him, that their conspiratorial objective was the seizure "
"of the Kingdom and inheritance through the murder of the heir (Matt. 21:38). Wh"
"ile the liberals may view belief in the conspiracy view of history as absurd, o"
"r even as a sign of membership in the "lunatic fringe," the orthodox Christian "
"must assert it to be basic to the philosophy of history."

"ptance of the perspective of orthodox Christianity, for history is replete with"
" conspiracies, and many conspiracies, while very important, serve only to defle"

" make the conspiracy, however central to the stage of history, the main fact of"
