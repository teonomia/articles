msgid "The concept of evolution is a theory without proof which is held mainly for rel"
"igious reasons. Sir Arnold Lunn has written of Darwin, "His immense success was"
" partly due to the fact that he happened to restate these theories at the preci"
"se moment when theophobia (the fear or dislike of God) was on the increase." Ev"

"lution be true, then man has evolved out of chaos, and chaos is the source of p"

"igion of Revolution points out, on chaos, his source of power and regeneration."
" Revolution is planned chaos. Not God but chaos then becomes man's savior. The "
