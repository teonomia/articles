"ims on or against God, any more than the clay can say to thepotter, “Why hast t"
"hou made me thus?” (Rom. 9:20). We are God’s property byvirtue of creation, and"
", because of redemption, we are doubly His, “bought witha price.” Hence “we are"
" not(our) own” (I Cor. 6:19-20). We are the Lord’s, and His right to use us and"
" togovern us is total. Our creation, and election or reprobation, is of Hissove"
"reign counsel and choice, not ours. Thus, we have no basis for any validobjecti"
"on to anything God does. In the famous case of the man executed forgathering fi"
"rewood on the Sabbath (Num. 15:32-36), it was Gods prerogative todo as He had d"
"ecreed. We can understand the decision as judgment on apresumptuous sin (Num. 1"
"5:30-31); the offender deliberately expressed hiscontempt for God’s law and God"
"’s provision. It was an act of defiance andtreason. However, whether we underst"
"and God’s law or not, or whether or not itseems reasonable to us, it is binding"
" upon us, because the reason it rests onis God’s, not man’s. "

msgid "Moreover, whenever man sets himself up as the judge over God’sword, deciding fo"
"r himself which law is still useful to him or not, the word ofGod ceases in pra"
"ctice to be God’s word and becomes merely a resource manutilized when he needs "
"it. The authority then is man, not God. TimeMagazine, in commenting on the wide"
"spread ecclesiastical toleration andeven acceptance of homosexuality, reported "
"on the reaction of manyconservatives, noting, ‘”Since the Bible is so explicit,"
" they wonder if thechurch will have any basis for imposing any restrictions on "
"human behavior ifit votes moral acceptance of active homosexuality.”[1]Exactly."
" The new moral basis and authority is the word of man, or the word ofthe church"
" or state. By such decisions, men, churches, and states declarethemselves to be"
" gods walking on earth and delivering the new law for man. Bydenying the bindin"
"g nature of the Bible, they are declaring their word to bethe higher and more a"
"uthoritative word. The criterion for action becomes thenthe word and will of ma"

"ew with actor James Caan, who confesses that nothing boldshis interest very lon"
"g, except acting, and acting must be fun to hold hisinterest. “It’s not only my"
" acting, but I don’t do anything unless I’m going toenjoy it or feel good about"
" it.” Caan dislikes work and responsibility: “Whenyou work, you have to assume "
"the responsibility and have the discipline, but Idon’t want to have to do anyth"
"ing. The more I have to be somewhere at a certaintime or do something, the more"
" I don’t want to do it.” He admits to guiltfeelings but hopes to rid himself of"
" them.[2]Caan expresses with honesty and candor the characteristics of most mod"
"erns.When man denies God, he substitutes for God either his own ultimacy or the"
"ultimacy of some institution or agency. If he affirms his own ultimacy, then he"
"denies the validity of any authority over him, and he rebells against authority"
"and discipline. "

"is not only antinomianism which marks most churches butanti-Christianity. It is"

"f surrender to mean as little as possible,to be as little binding as possible, "
"and to be in effect another word, the wordof the theologian in question. The fa"

"historical process whereby man comesto a new insight into himself and the world"
"; and the resurrection becomes animpossible possibility which has nothing to do"

" not orders. Indeed, I may go to Calvin, Luther,Augustine, and others, to schol"
"ars Christian and non-Christian, for insights,for data, and for learned studies"
", but when I go to the Bible I must go to hearGod’s marching orders for my life"
". I cannot treat the Bible as a devotionalmanual designed to give me peace of m"
"ind or a “higher plane” of living: it is acommand book which can disturb my pea"
"ce with its orders, and it tells me that Ican only find peace in obeying the Al"
"mighty. The Bible is not an inspirationalbook for my personal edification, nor "
"a book of beautiful thoughts and insightsfor my pleasure. It is the word of the"
" sovereign and Almighty God: I must hearand obey, I must believe and be faithfu"
"l, because God requires it. I amHis property, and His absolute possession. Ther"
"e can be nothing better thanthat. To be my own property and possession in a mea"
"ningless world is theultimate in misery and grief. But when the great and high "
"God, possessor ofheaven and earth (Gen. 14:19, 22), makes me His elect possessi"
"on by theadoption of grace through Jesus Christ, I must answer to His every ens"
