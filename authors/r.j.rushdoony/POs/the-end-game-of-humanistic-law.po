"	Biblical law requires restitution and restoration. Humanistic law begins "
"by seeking the reformation of man by law. In reformatory legislation, the law-b"
"reaker is the goal of controls. The next step in humanistic law is regulatory l"
"egislation. Regulations seek to control all men to make crime impossible, or ne"
"arly so."

"	But humanistic law does not stop there. The third step is redistribution."
" The control of all men goes hand in hand with the control of all property. Men"
", land, and money are redistributed. Law becomes a total plan for the total sal"
"vation of men and society by means of total control."

"	In education, the goal becomes the equalization of all children in every "
"way, so that grading is seen as an evil to be overcome or eliminated. Schooling"
" stresses, instead of the acquisition of knowledge, the acquisition of social a"
"ttitudes which will enable the child to belong to a leveled, redistributive soc"
"iety. Instead of an emphasis on excellence and individual achievement, there is"
" instead an emphatic demand for socialization and group dynamics."

"	In religion, humanism seeks by law to eliminate or bring into conformity "
"those churches which deny the Great Community as ultimate. All appeals must be "
"to caesar rather than to God. Ultimacy is held to be in the state, not in God, "
"so that the state is viewed as god walking on earth and as the agency of social"
" salvation. The Christian School is thus seen as a dangerous agency, because it"
" teaches a higher allegiance and trains youth in terms of another faith."

"	In economics, redistributive legislation in Marxist countries means the o"

"is achieved by a variety of means, most notably the inheritance tax and the inc"
"ome tax. In the United States, 75% of all farms, businesses, and activities are"
" wiped out by the death of the owner because of the confiscatory nature of the "
"inheritance tax. The income tax works annually to redistribute wealth, as does "
"the property tax, and a variety of other taxes. In fact, the goal of taxation c"
"an no longer be said to be the maintenance of civil order and justice; rather, "
"its goal is social revolution by means of taxation. Taxation has indeed become "
"the new and most effective method of revolution; it is the reactionary redistri"

"The more liberal ones know that taxation is the more efficient means of revolut"
