"ty. But this is not all. Many of God's laws are without any provision for penal"
"ties by man, the state, or the church. An example of this is tithing. In Malach"
"i 3:8-12, we are told that God imposes penalties for failure to tithe, and bles"

"controlling all things. The goal of regenerate man in Christ is the kingdom of "
"God and the New Jerusalem, a realm wherein righteousness or justice dwells (2 P"

" against the God of all justice or righteousness and His law, which is justice."
" God's law is "the perfect law of liberty" (James 1:25), and it is a law hated "
"by all who are in sin, which is slavery (John 8:31-36)."

" God to establish God's order, beginning in their families."
