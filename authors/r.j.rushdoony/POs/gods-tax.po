msgid "The tithe is God’s tax. It is required of men by God as their landlord, because"
", as the Bible repeatedly declares, “The earth is the Lord’s” (Exod. 9:29; Ps. "
"24:1, etc.). God requires the tithe as His tax, but not, as Jesus Christ declar"
"ed, at the expense of “the weightier matters of the law, judgment [justice], me"
"rcy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone”"
" (Matt. 23:23), that is, tithing must go hand in hand with godly morality."

msgid "The basic premise of the tithe is thus that “The earth is the Lord’s,” and He b"
"estows it upon men in return for the tithe and the obedience of faith. Where me"

msgid "Because “The earth is the Lord’s,” it cannot be claimed by the state, taxed by "
"the state, or seized by the state. Such actions are the mark of a tyrant (1 Sam"
". 8:11–18). The story of Naboth and his vineyard is a classic case of the tyran"
"ny of an expropriating state and ruler."

"n only is it entitled to receive the tithe. If men give to a church that denies"
" Jesus Christ, which preaches an anti-Christian social gospel, and which procla"
"ims another plan of salvation, to give to that church is not to give a tithe to"
" God but against Him. It means participating in an anti-Christian enterprise."
