msgid "One of the many things people fail to understand about God is that the Lord is "
"no respecter of excuses. In Genesis 3:9–19, God makes it clear that He regards "
"all excuses as only ground for condemnation and judgment."

msgid "Man can never approach God with anything other than perfect faith and obedience"
". This Jesus Christ has done in our stead, and, in addition to this, has given "
"us grace to obey Him. We are thus required to give Him the obedience of faith, "
"to recognize that we have been called, not to disobey God’s law, but to obey it"
" and to serve Him in every area of life."

msgid "But man prefers the way of excuses to the way of obedience. Our Lord ridiculed "
"and condemned excuses in His parable of the unwilling guests, who made excuses "
"to avoid the invitation. One man said, “I have bought a piece of ground, and I "
"must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.” Another man said, “I ha"
"ve bought five yoke of oxen, and go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused."
"” And another said, “I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come” (Luke "
"14:16–20). Christ was emphatic that excuses not only have no standing with God "
"but excite instead His anger."

msgid "A world which is governed by excuses is a dangerous one. It means that, if you "
"feel that your sin has value to you, then you have an excuse for sin. It means "
"that a worker is free to destroy or harm an employer’s property if he dislikes "
"his wages. It means that we excuse our children’s delinquencies because we feel"
" sorry for them, or love them."

msgid "In brief, excuses serve as a means of justifying sin, something God will not pe"
"rmit. God will, however, justify, by His sovereign grace, the repentant sinner."
" The world of excuses is the realm of sin justified. The world of grace is the "
"realm of sinners justified and made a new creation in order “[t]hat the righteo"
"usness of the law might be fulfilled in us” (Rom. 8:4)."
