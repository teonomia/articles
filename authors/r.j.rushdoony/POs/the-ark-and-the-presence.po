msgid "The doctrine of the ark of the covenant is basic to the doctrine of the church,"
" but, unfortunately is very much neglected and by-passed. This neglect is due i"
"n large part to controversy, hostility, and ill-will between Christians and Jew"
"s over the centuries. At the beginning, Judea was hostile to Christianity as a "
"schismatic group of Jews; during the first century, the church was overwhelming"
"ly Jewish. The fall of Jerusalem intensified that hostility. After the fall of "
"Rome, Christian missionaries and Jewish merchants tended to work together among"
" the barbarians as common forces for civilization. With the Crusades, hostility"
" towards and persecution of Jews for religious reasons began. Both the earlier "
"Jewish hostility and the later Christian hostility had far-reaching effects on "
"both groups. After the apostolic age, Jewish scholars re-interpreted the Old Te"
"stament to down-grade everything which pointed to Christ; the doctrine of the a"
"tonement was one of the casualties, so that the basic fact of the covenant ceas"
"ed to have its earlier meaning. In the Christian Church, the Old Testament was "
"down-graded after c. 1000 A.D. out of hostility to the Jews, and the slow but s"
"teady attrition led to modern antinomianism; here also the doctrine of the cove"
"nant suffered."

"er in his summary of what the ark was. It was "the symbol and vehicle of the pr"
"esence of the revelation of Jehovah among his people." We can be more specific "
"than Oehler is: the ark of the covenant set forth the real presence of God amon"
"g His covenant people. The doctrine of the real presence is basic to Scripture."
" Most Protestants are fearful of the doctrine, because it seems to point to Rom"
"e, or at the least to Lutheranism. On the contrary, it points to the Bible and "
"to the ark of the covenant. The Roman Catholic doctrine, as well as the Luthera"
"n version, points to Greek philosophy, as do various doctrines of Eastern churc"
"hes. My hostility to Greek premises is very great; this should not blind one, h"
"owever, to the fact that the doctrine of the real presence is not tied to this "
"philosophy."

" Scripture in Genesis 3:24, barring the entrance to the Garden of Eden. Next, i"
"n Exodus 25:20, the cherubim protect and shade the ark. Again, in Psalm 18:11, "
"we meet the cherubim as the cloudy chariots on which the Lord rides. In Ezekiel"
" 10:1ff., and Revelation 4:6-11., the cherubim are called living creatures. Whe"
"n God manifests Himself to the world, the cherubim reflect His glory to make Go"
"d accessible to man's eyes. God's real presence is veiled as well as marked by "
"the cherubim. In their appearance, they evoke many natural phenomena, indicatin"
"g that this world itself reveals God to us, and God's real presence in it trans"
"figures things around Him. The cherubim signify the presence of God, and, becau"
"se God in His majesty is beyond the grasp of man's mind, so too the very beings"
