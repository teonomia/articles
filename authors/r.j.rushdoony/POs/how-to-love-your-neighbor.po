msgid "A great many preachers have been working a Bible verse overtime these days, as "
"they plead for the grape “strikers” in Delano, the people of Africa, India, Wat"
"ts, and other points to the left. This much-abused text is Leviticus 19:18: “[T"
"]hou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” If these men are right in their inte"
"rpretation of the Bible, we had better line up with them. If not, they should b"

msgid "Now, what does the Bible say about loving our neighbor? First of all, Moses mad"
"e it clear that it included all men, foreigners, and enemies, and he made it cl"
"ear that it included any visiting Egyptians in Palestine, even though they were"
" the Israelites’ recent oppressors (Lev. 19:33, 34). We are therefore duty-boun"
"d to love our enemies; but what does it mean to love them?"

msgid "Jesus Christ, and Saint Paul as well, both defined the meaning of love in the B"
"iblical sense: it is the keeping of the second table of the Ten Commandments (M"
"att. 19:18–19; Rom. 13:8–10). Let us analyze what this means. First, “[t]hou sh"
"alt not kill”; my neighbor’s life is God-given, and it cannot be taken apart fr"
"om God’s law, for capital crimes and in lawful warfare I must therefore respect"
" every man’s right to life. Second, “[t]hou shalt not commit adultery”; I must "
"respect the God-given sanctity of my neighbor’s home. Third, “[t]hou shalt not "
"steal”; I must respect property as a God-given condition of human life, and I m"
"ust not violate this right. Fourth, “[t]hou shalt not bear false witness”; I mu"
"st respect my neighbor’s and enemy’s God-given rights not only in word and deed"
", but in thought as well. In short, as Paul said, “love is the fulfilling of th"
"e law” (Rom. 13:10). If we respect all men’s rights to life, home, property, an"
"d reputation in word, deed, and thought, we keep this law. We may dislike some "
"men, but if we respect these God-given rights, we keep the law."

msgid "The false preaching of this verse, and others as well, has led to the disintegr"

"ll kinds of civil disorder and revolutionary activity. But the Bible is emphati"
"c: “[L]ove is the fulfilling of the law,” God’s law, and godly obedience to hum"
"an authorities, not disobedience and lawlessness. Our answer to such men should"
" be blunt: “I love my neighbor; I respect his right to life, home, property, an"
"d reputation in word, thought, and deed. Why don’t you?” If the subversion of o"
"ur country is an important matter, and treason a capital offense, what shall we"
