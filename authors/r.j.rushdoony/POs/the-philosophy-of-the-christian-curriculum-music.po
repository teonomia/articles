msgid "Music in the modern era has had this focus and concern to an increasing degree."
" It began very much under the influence of Christian music, so that, whether on"
" the classical or the popular level, music, from the Enlightenment on, shows th"
"e clear but waning impact of Christian music. In the 20th century, this influen"
"ce has become more remote, and, in fact, a contrary influence began to appear, "
"the influence of non-Christian music on church music. This was far from new. Mu"
"ch earlier, operatic and romantic music had exercised its influences, but with "
"the 20th century, the determination of church music by secular music became esp"
"ecially dominant."

msgid "Meanwhile, humanistic music had also taken two directions which reflected the s"
"chizophrenia implicit in its nature. First, in popular music there came in full"
" bloom from jazz to acid rock music the concentration on the use of music to ex"
"ploit feeling for the sake of feeling. Music had never been devoid of emotion, "
"and it had always been the function of music to arouse emotions and to enhance "
"them. This emotional function of music had always been subject, however, to a s"
"pecific purpose other than feeling as such. The emotions aroused could be awe, "
"reverence, joy, or whatever else was desired, in terms of a religious, festival"
", martial, marital, or other purpose. ... Now the emphasis is on feeling for it"
"s own sake. Not surprisingly, in acid rock, music is allied to narcotic to prod"
"uce an emotionalism which cuts all ties to reality to enter into "pure" emotion"
"alism. Of course, this goal is an impossible one. The individual cannot escape "
"from God's reality; he carries it into the drugged world of music and hence the"
" radical results of such music. The desire is for increased drugs and escapist "
"music, and a wilder flight from reality. In all this, humanism's emphasis on th"
"e individual and his autonomous self and enrichment is very much in evidence."

msgid "Second, in "classical" music, a similar emphasis on the individual has been in "
"evidence, but in a different direction. Composers have produced a rationalistic"
", overly intellectual music, one in which emotions are sometimes squeezed out. "
"Experimentation is made with new scales, dissonance, and new sounds, and also w"
"ith distortions..."

msgid "However, Christianity, if true to Scripture, must be the leader in music, not t"

"salms, is a hymn or song book. In both Old and New Testaments, believers are co"
"mmanded to sing."

msgid "Second, the title includes the support of musicians as a necessary part of wors"
