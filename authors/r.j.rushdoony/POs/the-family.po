msgid "The modern age has created a new view of law. Law is seen as confronting two re"
"alms; the one realm, the public sphere, belongs to the state and its law and ju"
"risdiction. The other sphere is the private realm, which is outside the law of "
"the state. The distinction is a modern fiction, created by the statists. Moreov"
"er, the right to define the extent of the public realm is reserved to the state"
". Naturally, the state has steadily increased its claims to the detriment of th"
"e private sphere, which has grown steadily smaller."

"tion of law is the arrogant claim of the state to be the sole source of public "
"law, and the only definer thereof. This claim is as old as paganism, and yet it"
" is fairly new in Christendom and is a product of the humanism of the modern ag"
"e. Christian civilization has recognized several realms of public law, and the "
"most notable of these has been family law. Other spheres of public law have inc"
"luded church law, (Christian) school law (as in the medieval university and sin"

"used to thinking of two kinds of property control, private ownership and state "

". We have survivals of this form of property control in various community prope"
"rty laws, which mean family property. Community here has the older sense of fam"

"ol, and in various other ways to play god over property. Community property law"
