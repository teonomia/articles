msgid "The death of an age is a bloody business. Men, disillusioned with the promises "
"of their faith, yet unwilling to surrender them, strike out at everything in ra"
"ge and in frustration. Like a rudderless ship, the civilization loses its direc"
"tion and is driven by events instead of driving through them. Today, in the las"
"t days of humanism, as men steadily destroy their world, it is important for us"
" to understand the meaning of the times and act in terms of that knowledge. The"

"	Humanism is dying because its faith is false, and its promises bankrupt. "
"Let us examine that faith in order to understand more clearly its failure. Firs"
"t of all, humanism presupposes a faith in man, even to insisting on the basic g"
"oodness of man. This idealistic affirmation comes with it the assumption that e"
"vil is not in man but rather in his environment. Change the environment, and yo"
"u thereby change man, it is held. As a result, humanistic sociology and politic"
"s are rigorously environmental: every effort is made to provide better housing,"
" better education, every kind of environmental control, but, in all of this, ma"
"n's evil only seems to proliferate."

"	As a result, many humanists have themselves abandoned their faith in man."
" Nietzsche, ahead of most, proclaimed the need of superman to replace man, and "
"evolutionists and socialists have dedicated themselves to working towards the c"

"	A second basic concept of the humanistic faith is its affirmation that ma"

"	The fourth basic concept of the religion of humanism is its belief in the"
" inevitability of progress. This is a secularized version of the belief in Prov"
"idence. Humanism, by denying God, has depersonalized history. The world and its"
" events are no longer the plan and handiwork of a personal, sovereign God; they"
" are the product of anonymous, impersonal social forces. These impersonal force"
"s, with planning man now guiding his own evolution, are supposed to ensure, not"
" only progress, but more rapid progress. The result is, as Robert L. Heilbroner"
", in The Future as History, has termed it, a "philosophy of expectations." In t"
"erms of humanism, mankind should now be moving rapidly into a paradise on earth"
". In the 1920s and 1930s, teachers and professors often waxed lyrical in portra"
"ying the golden age which scientific planning would usher in. Today, the most i"
"ntelligent of humanism's children are most in revolt against its failure to del"
"iver on its promises. According to Kenneth Keniston, in the November, 1969, Yal"
"e Alumni Magazine, the Students involved in campus protests are usually the mos"
"t intelligent on the campus. "One study finds that the best way to predict whet"
"her a college will have anti-war protests is to count the number of National Me"
"rit Scholars in the freshman class... Furthermore, protesting students have bee"
"n shown again and again to be an elite within each college and university more "
"privileged in background, more academically successful, more socially concerned"
" than their less active classmates... It is partly for this reason that student"
" unrest concerns us profoundly. To be sure, if we consider white students (and "
"I will not discuss black militants here), only a minority of America's almost 7"
",000,000 college students are vocally disaffected. Yet if this minority is sele"
"ctively drawn from the future leaders of our society, does this fact not threat"
