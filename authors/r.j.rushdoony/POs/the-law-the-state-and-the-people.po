"	The nature and the meaning of law have changed from one culture to anothe"
"r. First of all, all law is religious in its presuppositions, because it is an "
"expression of basic and ultimate values. Laws protect those values most importa"
"nt to a society and prescribe those regarded as alien and evil. Every legal sys"
"tem embodies a concept of ultimate concern, of religion and ethics. Second, law"
"s, beside protecting values, also protect men. The men protected in contemporar"
"y states can be, theoretically, all men within the society, the state and its a"
"gents, or one class of men, such as the proletariat. It is not our concern at t"
"he moment whether or not the protection is theoretical or actual. In antiquity,"
" the law was commonly royal law; even more, it was often the law of an ostensib"
"ly divine-human King whose word was law. In some sense, the law is always parti"
"al; it protects those whom the law deems just and prosecutes those suspected of"
" injustice. Where the partiality of the law is determined by men, all who diffe"
"r from the law-makers can be judged illicit and criminal. There is thus no free"
"dom for capitalists in the soviet Union, and there are limitations at times on "
"the freedom of communists in some democracies. where laws come from men, men wi"
"ll determine the limits of the law’s protection."

"f pre-theoretical presuppositions which are in essence religious. The important"
" question to ask of law is the nature of its interest or concern. The interest "
"can be royal, democratic, fascist, racist, and so on. In every case, it is an e"
"xpression of values."

"	Historically, law, which we like to see as the expression of justice, has"
" been very commonly seen as injustice. The royal law in India for centuries was"
" exploitive of the peoples and seen as oppressive. One aging missionary who had"
" a contact with elderly Chinese who had seen the rules of the empress, the “rep"
"ublic,” and the communists, asked them about the difference from one regime to "
"another as they affected them, the peasants. Their answer was that all things w"
"ere essentially the same: “All masters want their will and our work.” Theoretic"
"ians of the law like to see it as equivalent to justice. During most of history"
", men have seen it as the oppressive will of the masters."

"	Ancient Israel was an exception to this. Law-making was recognized in tim"
"es of faithfulness as God's prerogative, not man’s, and God had revealed His co"
"venant law through Moses. This law was defended and expounded by the prophets, "
"and it was binding for the King and the people. Nathan’s indictment of King Dav"
"id, one of a long series of such confrontations, was without parallel in antiqu"
"ity. A law beyond man and from God judged both kings and peoples, indeed, all m"

"	For our purposes here, a few limited aspects of Biblical law must be note"
"d. First, every system of law imposes certain restraints on some for the freedo"
"m of others. Outside of Biblical law, these restraints are on one segment of me"
"n for the freedom of another, sometimes only a few. In Plato’s Republic, the fr"
"ee are very few; they are the philosopher-Kings. In other systems, other elites"
" are free and the rest restrained. Second, not only is freedom in a social orde"
"r selective, but it is also both positive and negative. Thus, in Soviet Russia,"
" there is a freedom from capitalism, and a freedom for the state to control its"
" citizenry. A man who exercises the freedom to sin thereby ensures freedom from"
" virtue and its many blessings. No stand or act has a single consequence; we ar"
"e at all times in a nexus of events, past, present, and future. Biblical law gi"
"ves us freedom from men and from the state, but not from God. The social order "
"created by Biblical law distrusts man as a sinner and thus minimizes his contro"
"ls while stressing his responsibility."

"	This means, third, that Biblical law leads to a minimal state. The king o"
"r judge in Israel had less power than is now routine for the higher officials o"
"f state bureaucracies. The stress of Biblical law is on man’s responsibility to"
" God and to his fellow men under God. Man must distrust himself, his fellow men"
", and his rulers. In Isaiah's words, “Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his"
" nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?” (Isa. 2:22). Power and author"
"ity are not to be accorded to men apart from God’s word and law. At the same ti"

"ph. 4:25)."

"	Much more can be said of Biblical law, but, for our present purposes, thi"
"s suffices. With the progressive conversion of the Western world to Christ, the"
" canon of society and the states became God’s law-word, so that a new element w"
"as introduced into the life of the law. Rome early saw the far-reaching implica"
"tions of Christianity and therefore resisted it. Two rival doctrines of soverei"
"gnty and law were at war one with another, the sovereignty of God and His law v"

"	As a result of this Christian factor, the interest of a social order is a"
" divided one. It is popular now with statists to speak of the state interest an"
"d to equate it with the public interest. This identification was basic to ancie"
"nt tyrannies and is now a commonplace with our newer ones. Its modern origins a"
"re in Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who identified the state as the voice of the peopl"
"e’s general will. This identification has made possible the tyrannies of modern"
" Marxism and National Socialism. Rousseau held that the public “must be taught "
"to know what it is that it wills.” In the Social Contract, Rousseau held that w"
"hile the will of the people may not correspond to the general will, “The genera"
"l will is always right and tends always to the public good; but it does not fol"
"low that the deliberations of the people always have the same rectitude...There"
" is often a great difference between the will of all and the general will.” Thi"
"s identification of the true will of the people as the general will, and the ge"
"neral will with the state, led to a revival of the ancient pagan state. After H"
"egel, the state was indeed a god walking on earth."

"	The French Revolution began the idealization of the state to a degree pre"
"viously unknown in the western world. It also rationalized tyranny in the name "

"dom expanded. The statement of James Otis in New England, that a man's house is"
" his castle, was in this tradition, which goes back to the Middle Ages, Thomas "
"Becket, the Magna Carta, and more. The papacy had a role in this, a major one, "

"	We must now turn to a key factor in all this. As we have seen, this Chris"

" an important example of this in Old Testament history. European, English, and "
"American histories give us many more examples of this. The fact which made poss"
"ible this differentiation and more was law, God’s law. Unlike all other laws, G"
"od's law was not identified with any class, race, or people; it judged the Hebr"
