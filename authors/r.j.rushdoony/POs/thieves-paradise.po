msgid "Supposing we want to create a social order for the welfare of thieves and for t"
"heir security, how shall we do it? The world must be made safe for stealing and"
" for thieves, of course. We must therefore create a social order in which the t"
"hieves can steal but where no one can rob a thief. Next, we must make stealing "
"respectable. Simple, obvious, and direct theft involves robbing a victim person"
"ally. Indirect theft means hiring someone else to do it. Legalized theft is get"
"ting civil government to do it for us, and this has the most respectability and"
" prestige, so our thieves’ paradise must have it."

"pproval from economists and experts, and what can better qualify than a managed"
" money which is debased and inflated? Inflation is a simple process: it is what"
" happens when a dishonest farmer adds water to the milk. Past a certain point, "
"it ceases to be even watered milk; it is simply milky water. But, fortunately, "
"the inflation of money is respectable and legal in our thieves’ paradise, becau"
"se the thieves are in charge, not the farmers."

msgid "Another highly respectable device in our thieves’ paradise is taxation. God, of"
" course, is content with only a tithe, but any self-respecting thief knows that"
" a sucker must be taken all the way. Is taxation past forty percent? Well, the "
"chicken is far from plucked!"

"ools, and colleges are important. These institutions can tell the people how mo"

" than a world in which the good people are persuaded that it is their duty to b"
"e plucked? Moreover, why not add to this new morality of a thieves’ paradise th"
"e idea of a world union of thieves to avoid wasteful competition? After all, it"
" is the duty of all good thieves to concentrate on plundering the people. This "
"is a common faith all thieves can unite on. Why not unite then into one grand w"
"orld order dedicated to the promotion of plunder on a world scale?"

msgid "Of course, one big roadblock remains. God, somehow, has not caught up with the "
"times and is hopelessly out of date. He still insists, “Thou shalt not steal.” "
"Such an obsolete and antiquated morality, and this very dated God, must be gent"
"ly done away with. If we say, “Thou shalt not steal,” it applies only to the ci"
"tizens, who must not steal from the thieves. The thieves’ state is beyond this "
"law, and, as for God, we can declare Him dead. All problems are now taken care "
"of except one. As Pilate and the Sanhedrin found out once before, God is very u"
"ncooperative: He won’t stay dead! And He does make trouble for all self-respect"
"ing thieves. Times have changed, but God hasn’t. It makes for quite a problem ("
"but not for God!)."
