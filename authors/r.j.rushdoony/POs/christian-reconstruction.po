msgid "It is urgently important that we think now of Christian reconstruction, but our"
" thinking cannot be idle talk: it must be both Biblical and also practically ap"
"plied in our daily life. There are many people ready to eliminate statism, but "
"they have nothing but wishing to replace it. How then will independent schools,"
" private welfare, and individual initiative deal with the vast complex of our s"
"ocial problems? Already most of our Christian conservative causes, and Christia"
"n schools, are continually short of funds. What is the answer? In any advanced "
"social order, social financing is a major public necessity. The social order ca"
"nnot exist without a vast network of social institutions which require financin"
"g and support. If a Christian concept of social financing is lacking, then the "
"state moves in quickly to supply the lack and gain the social control which res"
"ults. Social financing means social power."

msgid "The Bible provides, as the foundation law, in the practical realm, of a godly s"
"ocial order, the law of the tithe. To understand the tithe, it is important to "
"know that Biblical law has no property tax\ the right to tax real property is i"
"mplicitly denied to the state, because the state has no title to the earth. Rep"
"eatedly, the Bible declares, "The earth is the LORD'S (Exodus 9:29, Deut. 10: 1"
"4, Ps. 24: 1,1 Cor. 10: 26, etc.); therefore, only God can tax the earth, For t"
"he state to claim the right to tax the earth is for the state to make itself th"
"e god and creator of the earth, whereas the state is instead God's ministry of "
"justice (Romans 13: 1-8)."

msgid "The immunity of land from taxation by the state meant liberty. A man could not "
"be dispossessed of his land: every man had a basic security in his property. As"
" H. B. Rand, in his Digest of Biblical Law pointed out, "It was impossible to d"
"ispossess men of their inheritance under the law of the Lord as no taxes were l"
"evied against land. Regardless of a man's personal commitments he could not dis"
"inherit his family by being dispossessed of his land forever." The land is not "
"the property of the state, and no state therefore has the right under God to le"
"vy taxes against God's possessions. The Bible cites it as a sign of tyranny whe"
"n the state claims the right to take as much as God, i.e., a tithe, or ten perc"
"ent of one's increase. Thus, Samuel said of the tyrant, "He will, besides, take"
" a tenth of your grain crop and of your vineyards and give it to his officers a"
"nd to his servants...He will appropriate a tenth of your flocks, too, and you y"
"ourselves will become his servants" (I Samuel 8:15,17, Berkeley Version). Today"
", civil government takes more than a tenth of our income: it takes about 45 per"
"cent!"

msgid "When America was colonized, the settlers in every colony made Biblical law thei"

"The inscription on the Liberty Bell is taken from the Biblical land law: "procl"
"aim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof (Lev. 25:1"
"0). In the first session of the Continental Congress in 1774, Congress denied t"
"hat Parliament could tax real property. Gottfried Dietze has summarized the Ame"
"rican opinion then: "As to property, the delegates felt it should be free from "
"seizure and taxation." The property tax came in very slowly, and it appeared fi"
"rst in New England, coinciding with the spread of Deism and Unitarianism, as we"
"ll as atheism. Such anti-Christian men saw the state as man's savior, and as a "
"result they favored placing more and more in the hands of the state. The South "
"was the last area to accept the property tax, and it was largely forced on the "
"South by post-Civil War Reconstruction. Moreover, as far as possible, when the "
"property tax was adopted in the pre-Civil War era, conservative elements limite"
"d it to the county and retained the legal requirement that only owners of real "
"property could vote on the county level."

"ucational institutions of Israel, and also of colonial and early America. In fa"
"ct, in the United States the tithe was for many years legally binding on all me"
"n, and failure to pay it was a civil offense. The tithe supported the churches,"
" Christian schools, and colleges. When Virginia repealed such a law, which made"
" payment of the tithe mandatory, George Washington expressed his disapproval in"
" a letter to George Mason, October 3,1785. He believed he said, in "making peop"
"le pay toward the support of that which they profess." The position Washington "
"took was one which the early church had established as soon as any country beca"
"me Christian. State laws began to require tithes from the 4th century on, becau"
"se it was believed that a country could only deny God His tax at its peril, and"
" therefore the various civil governments required all their citizens to pay tit"
"hes, not to the state but to the church. From the end of the 18th century, and "
"especially in the last century, such laws have steadily disappeared as a result"
" of the atheistic and revolutionary movements of our times."

" tithe is described in Leviticus 27:30-33. A tenth of all produce or production"

"wanted to retain this tenth in its original form, i. e., as fruit or grain, he "

" it was originally given, had charge of religion, education, and various other "
"functions. The tithe was paid six years in seven, the seventh being a rest for "

"o the first two was meant. Maimonides in the 12th century held that this third "
"tithe was the second tithe shared, but Aben Ezra disagreed. This tithe was a ki"
"nd of social welfare tithe, to be shared with lowly foreigners, not as a hand-o"
"ut, but in common feasting and rejoicing before the Lord. As Lansdell pointed o"
"ut, Christ did not repeal the law of tithing (pp. 117-126). Jesus did not conde"
"mn the Pharisees for tithings: "these ought ye to have done, and not to leave t"
"he other undone", that is, "the weightier matters of the law, judgment (justice"
"), mercy, and faith" (Matthew 23: 23). Chrysostom declared, "If under the law i"
"t were dangerous to neglect tithes, consider how great a danger there is now" ("
"Horn, iv, in Eph. ii). Joseph Bingham, in The Antiquities of the Church, wrote "
"of the early church that "the ancients believed the law about tithes not to be "
"merely a ceremonial or political command, but of moral and perpetual obligation"

" As Rand noted, "Nowhere in the Bible is there any indication that property rig"
"hts are to ever be abolished. On the contrary, such rights are emphasized and s"
"afeguards are placed around that property to protect a man and his possessions."

msgid "Sixth, the tithe restores the necessary spiritual basis to Christian action. To"
"day, many people do give generously to various causes, but their giving is impu"

"ho provides the best Hollywoodish production, and the best press-agentry, gets "
"the money. When people are disillusioned with such a project, they move on to l"
"ook for another exciting and glamorous action. But the law of the tithe makes c"
"lear it is God's money and must go to God's causes, to Christian worship, educa"
"tion, outreach, and reconstruction. The tithe cannot be channeled to "exciting""
" causes but to godly causes, to solid, steady, consistently Biblical causes. An"
"d the tithe must bear the whole burden of Christian reconstruction. Conservativ"
"e giving goes much of the time to fighting against the inroads of the enemy, wh"

msgid "Seventh, the tithe restores power to the little man. Today, it is the rich man "
"who dominates most causes, his money counts; he can donate a hundred thousand o"
"r a million and make his influence felt. But a thousand little men who tithe ca"
"n far outweigh the rich man. They can keep a Christian cause from being dominat"
"ed by a handful. Tithing is the way for the little man to have power with God's"
" blessing. A hundred men paying an average tithe of $100 a month means $10,000 "
"monthly, which means that a relatively small group is capable of great things a"
"nd will gain God's blessing in the process. Socialism has filled a void vacated"
" by Christians. The spread of Unitarianism and atheism in the United States was"
" closely followed by the spread of socialism. It was not by accident that the e"
"arly American socialists of 1800-1860 attacked the tithe. To break down tithing"
" meant that another source of social financing had to be forthcoming, the centr"
"al civil government. And it was the total social impact of the little man's tit"
"he that was so over-powering: the millionaires were few, but the little people "
"were many. Make no mistake about it: social financing is a social necessity. It"
" will either be done by an irresponsible and godless state, subsidizing irrespo"
"nsibility and godlessness and penalizing the godly, or it will be done by godly"
" men, who, through Biblically grounded administration and godly wisdom, will fu"
"rther social order, true churches, Christian education, and a society flourishi"
"ng in liberty under God."
