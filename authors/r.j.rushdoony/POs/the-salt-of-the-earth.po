"	Early in 1996, an incident occurred which opened my eyes to a sad fact. A"
"bout six or eight of our Chalcedon fellowship were eating together at a restaur"
"ant. We began with prayer as usual. (If the place is too noisy, we have silent "
"prayer.) When we finished praying, a man at another table came over to thank us"
" for praying! I suddenly realized that I could not recall when I last saw other"
" people praying at a restaurant, and it distressed me."

"	Our Lord, in Matthew 5:13-14, requires us to be the salt of the earth and"
" the light of the world. The use of salt over the centuries has been primarily "
"as a preservative, to keep food usable prior to refrigeration’s invention. In m"
"y lifetime, as a boy, our cellar had crocks which kept fish and cheese in a bri"
"ne. Later, on the Indian Reservation, I preserved trout and beef in the same wa"
"y. We are required by Our Lord to keep the world from radical corruption by bei"
"ng salt, while we strive to bring men and nations to Christ by being light to t"

" “a disciple of the apostles,” and he speaks of Christianity as being a new thi"

"as the abused but preserving power among the peoples. In Chap. VI, we are told "
"that Christians are the soul of the world, i.e., “what the soul is in the body,"
" that are Christians in the world,” its life-giving power."
