"	Recently a very fine television preacher who should know better dismissed"
" postmillennialism as a product of a Darwinian and evolutionary perspective, an"
"d he also equated it with the social gospel. This falsehood has been so often r"
"epeated that few stop to consider how obviously false it is.\n"
"	First of all,"
" postmillennialism long pre-dates Darwin and was an important force in the age "
"of discovery and exploration. Hakluyt’s Voyages tell us plainly how many of the"
" navigators and explorers were governed by this faith. It was also a part of th"
"e Reformation, was shared by many of the Westminister Assembly divines, and it "
"appears in the Larger catechism. Darwinism came very much later, and, in fact, "
"undermined the post-millennial position.\n"
"	Second, the reason why evolution "
"undermined the prevailing post-millennial perspective was because it replaced t"
"he world of God’s total providence with Darwin’s world of total chance. Postmil"
"lennialism stresses the reality of Romans 8:28 that God makes all things work t"
"ogether for good for them who love Him, for all who are called according to His"
" purpose. The world is God’s creation and moves to fulfill His goals. Evolution"
" sees the universe as “red in tooth and claw;” if anything develops, it is by c"
"hance or accident. chance replaces predestination, and total meaninglessness re"
"places God’s total meaning. The churches which accepted Darwin dropped postmill"
"ennialism.\n"
"	Third, because with Darwin the world was now without meaning, a"
"nd because there was no God with His government and meaning, the believers in e"
"volution replaced God and His providence with the state and the social gospel. "
"The social gospel is the antithesis of postmillennialism. It sees the state as "
"the only true providence of man, whereas the rise of postmillennialism in every"
" era has meant a renewed awareness of the providence of God.\n"
"	To equate evo"
"lutionary faith with postmillennialism is like identifying good and evil. It in"
"volves a radical confusion of meaning, and it reduces history and logic to nons"
"ense.\n"
"	As creationism has revived, so too has postmillennialism because the"
" more closely God’s creating hand and government are linked to this world, the "
"more men will understand the force of Romans 8:28, and the more literally they "
"will take such promises as Isaiah 60:12, “For the nation and kingdom that will "
"not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.” The S"
"cripture declares of our Lord, “He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, an"
"d from the river unto the ends of the earth” (Ps. 72:8). This is postmillennial"
"ism, not Darwinism!\n"
"	Postmillennialism believes that the God who created he"
"aven and earth cannot be defeated, either by man or by Satan. His declared purp"
"ose from the beginning to the end shall be accomplished, and nothing can stay H"
"is hand. “All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD; and "
"all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee. For the kingdom is t"
"he LORD’s and he is the governor among the nations” (Ps. 22:27-28). “Yea, all k"
"ings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him” (Ps. 72:11). Can "
"a Christian believe anything less? Ours is the God of victory and salvation."
