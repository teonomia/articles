msgid "In England, March 1966, the case of a 10-year-old girl became a national scanda"
"l. The girl, according to the AP news release, had only one offense, her habit "
"of wiping “her knife and fork with a table napkin before meals…. Headmaster Wil"
"liam A. Mason told the child she should not wipe the cutlery. He said other chi"
"ldren might do likewise using handkerchiefs and this would not be hygienic.” Bu"
"t the girl wanted clean cutlery and persisted. She was then barred from the lun"
"chroom, and so her mother refused to send her to school. Mother and child were "
"summoned to juvenile court; the mother expected to be fined, but also to have a"
" chance to register her protest. Instead, the judge ruled her an unfit mother a"
"nd committed the child to a children’s home on no other ground than this simple"
" disobedience."
