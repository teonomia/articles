"	A frequent objection raised by many to the doctrines of predestination an"
"d providence is that such doctrines render untenable and impossible any concept"
" of responsibility and prayer. If God predestines and totally governs all thing"
"s, then how can man be held responsible for his actions, and what need is there"
" then for prayer when God ordains all things absolutely?"

"	This is a very logical argument and an unanswerable one only if we insist"
" that the limits of logic and of possibility are what Aristotle and humanism in"
" any form conceive them to be. This we can never grant, for then no doctrine of"
" Scripture stands, and we must logically reject the whole of it. Creation, the "
"triune God, the doctrine of predestination, providence, atonement, and much, mu"
"ch more constitute impossibilities in terms of the logic of humanism."

"	When, however, our views of reality, possibility, and logic are governed,"

"possibilities of God, not of man. "With God all things are possible" (Matt. 19:"

"	Calvin saw four "rules" of prayer. First, in prayer our heart and mind se"
"t aside all other matters and give themselves over to conversation with God. Se"
"cond, in asking, we must truly feel our wants and believe that the Lord is the "
"supplier thereof. This means a faith in God's absolute government, for otherwis"
"e we will look to ourselves to supply our needs. To be prayerless means to be w"
"ithout faith in God, and it manifests a trust in ourselves as our self-supplier"
". Third, this means divesting ourselves of all vain-glorious thoughts. It is ma"
"n's desire to be his own god (Gen. 3:5) which leads him to war against rather t"
"han communion with God, and it is this same spirit of autonomy which makes man "
"prayerless. Fourth, we are prayerless unless we believe that God can and will s"
"upply our needs."

"	Calvin, in setting forth these "rules" of prayer, warns against limiting "
"God to them. God, after all, did hear the prayer of an ungodly man who was unde"
"r judgment (I Kings 21:25-29). Prayer is in the name of the Lord. Solomon said,"
" "The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is"
" safe" (Prov. 18:10). That great Name, manifested to us, is Jesus Christ, God o"
"ur Savior, and therefore we pray in His name, "in Jesus Name," since God is und"
"er no obligation to honor our name or any petition. We are a judged, meritless "
"people, saved only by sovereign grace through Jesus Christ. Our only mediator i"
"s Jesus Christ, and our only legal status before the throne is in His Name. Hen"
"ce, all prayer is in Jesus' Name, save the Lord's Prayer, where we simply join "
"in and echo the prayer of Jesus Christ as the new and true Adam. In the Lord's "
"Prayer, we pray in His words and as members of His body. All prayer to God is t"
"hus through Jesus. As Calvin noted:"

"		It is certain that from the beginning no prayers had been heard bu"
"t for the sake of the Mediator. For this reason the Lord had appointed in the l"
"aw, that the priest alone should enter the sanctuary, bearing on his shoulders "
"the names of the tribes of Israel, and the same number of precious stones befor"
"e his breast; but that the people should stand without in the court, and there "
"unite their prayers with those of the priest. (Ex. xxviii.) The use of the sacr"
"ifice was to render their prayers effectual. The meaning, therefore, of that sh"
"adowy ceremony of the law was, that we are all banished from the presence of Go"
"d, and therefore need a mediator to appear in our name, to bear us on his shoul"
"ders, and bind us to his breast, that we may be heard in his person; and, moreo"
"ver, that the sprinkling of his blood purifies our prayers, which have been ass"
"erted to be otherwise never free from defilement.4"
