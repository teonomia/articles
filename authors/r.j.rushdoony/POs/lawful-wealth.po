"	Capitalization is the accumulation of wealth, the conversion of work, sav"

"hout some measure of capitalization. It is a serious error to assume that socia"
"lism and communism are opposed to capitalization or to capitalism; their opposi"
"tion is simply to private capitalism, but their dedicated policy is to state ca"
"pitalism. For the state to plan any program of progress, public works, or conqu"
"est, work, frugality, and forethought are necessary. The work is exacted from t"
"he people by force; the frugality or savings is again forced out of the people "
"by means of wage controls, compulsory savings and bond-buying programs, and sla"

"	State capitalism is seriously defective for a number of reasons. Most not"

msgid "Second, forethought is divorced from work and frugality, that is, the planners "
"are not the ones who provide the work and the sacrifice. As a result, the plann"
"ers have no brake of immediate consequences imposed upon them. They can be prod"
"igal in their waste of manpower and capital without bankruptcy, in that the sta"
"te compels the continuance of their non-economic and wasteful planning. The con"
"sequence is that, wherever planning is separated from work and savings, instead"
" of capitalization, the result is decapitalization. Socialism is thus by nature"
" imperialistic, in that it must periodically seize or annex a fresh territory i"
"n order to have fresh capital to gut by expropriation. State capitalism is thus"
" an agency of decapitalization."

"	Private capital is acquired basically in three ways, excluding private th"
"eft as an illegal and immoral means. These three ways are by work, inheritance,"
" and gift. Private capital must then be utilized by planning, and the loss is t"
"he planner’s loss, so that there is an incentive to efficiency in private capit"
"al, even where received by gift or by inheritance, which is lacking in state ca"
"pitalism. The immediacy of consequences, the direct liability of the private ca"
"pitalist to loss, makes private capital more responsible even where the private"
" capitalist is a thief. Where criminal syndicates like the Mafia enter into bus"
"iness, they do so with a ruthless eye towards profits and efficiency which is l"
"acking in state capitalism."

"	The pride is most terrible and insidious because it flouts the plainest o"

"alth is by God’s power, not her own, and it is given in accord with his covenan"

"	To return now to Deuteronomy 8:1, 18, the purpose of wealth is the establ"
"ishment of God’s covenant; its goal is that man prosper in his task of possessi"
"ng the earth, subduing it and exercising dominion over it. The means to lawful "
"wealth is the covenant law, the law of God. Capitalization is thus a radical an"
"d total task. Man must seek to subdue the earth and gain wealth as a means of r"
"estitution and restoration, as means of establishing God’s dominion in every re"
"alm. Wherever godly men establish their superior productivity and gain wealth, "
"they thereby glorify God. Wealth in itself is good, and a blessing of the Lord."
" It is trust in wealth rather than God which Scripture condemns (Ps. 49:6, 7). "
"We are told that, “When Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthe"
