"	In Speech and Reality (1970), Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy wrote of the social"

"anarchy. In anarchy, people and classes "do not care to come to an agreement." "
"Instead of ties uniting men, there are now divisions only, with each pursuing h"
"is own interest. Second, decadence is a very great evil. Decadence is manifeste"
"d at a critical point: parents do not have "the stamina of converting the next "
"generation to their own aims and ends. Decadence is the disease of liberalism t"
"oday." The consequence is the barbarization of the younger generation. Since th"
"ey are not made heirs of the past and its faith, they become the barbarians of "
"the present. (The modern family, like the modern school, is a school for barbar"
"ians.) "The only energy that can fight this evil is faith. Faith, properly spea"
"king, never is a belief in things of the past, but of the future. Lack of faith"
" is a synonym for decadence," Rosenstock-Huessy held."

"is war. War is a sign of impotence. A system or philosophy of life which has no"
" power to convert becomes imperialistic. For the zeal and faith of peaceful mis"
"sionary work it substitutes brutal terror. A failing faith resorts to war, beca"

"	All of these things are aspects of the eschatology of death. But there is"
" still another aspect. Because the modern taboo is death, people are prissy and"
" hesitant about the plain facts of dying. It is often assumed, out of fear, tha"
"t most deaths are costly, long, and lingering, which in most cases is not true."
" Death often comes quickly. It is also assumed that death comes to a bland man,"
" again not true. It comes to Christians and to unbelievers, and with many shade"
"s of difference. Death among some of the ungodly who die a lingering death unle"
"ashes a radical hatred of the living. One man, a life-long reprobate and adulte"
"rer, abandoned his wife as "too old" and moved in with a younger widow, whom he"
" enriched to a degree. When terminally ill, he was ordered out by his mistress,"
" and only his wife would have him. Instead of gratitude, he daily showered her "
"and their children with hatred, profanity, and abuse, hating them for their fai"
"th and health, "wasted" on them, he would shout, because they "didn't know how "
"to live." This is an aspect of the eschatology of death, its hatred for life an"
"d the living, and its will to destroy them. At the heart of this is what Wisdom"
