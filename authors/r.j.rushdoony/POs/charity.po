msgid "The Christian faith once meant that a believer responded to a dark world by act"
"ively working to bring God's grace and mercy to others, both by word and by dee"
"d. However, a modern, self-centered church has isolated the faith to a pietism "
"that relinquishes charitable responsibility to the state. The end result has be"
